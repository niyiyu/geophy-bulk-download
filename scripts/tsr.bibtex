This will not only allow for quicker handling of manuscripts, but also encourage authors to focus on one outstanding idea, observation, or finding. We feel such a focus will increase the visibility of the papers within the scientific community, and also make them easier to publicize with the media and the general public. We will encourage authors to submit data or processing products associated with their papers to a free, DOI‐granting, data repository prior to paper submission. A good example of such a repository is the one maintained by the International Seismological Centre, which accepts and curates event catalogs, velocity models, computer code, and more, at no cost to the author. In cases where additional methodological details are needed for the sake of clarity or reproducibility, The Seismic Record will accept an electronic supplement with the required information. However, manuscripts that naturally flow better as a single, long‐format document should be submitted to BSSA or SRL and not to The Seismic Record.},

We also employ CWI to find any velocity perturbation due to damage from SPE‐2, by comparing its coda with the collocated third SPE chemical explosion, SPE‐3.

The sequence initiated with the Mw 6.0 Amatrice event on 24 August 2016, followed by the Mw 5.9 Visso event on 26 October and the Mw 6.5 Norcia event on 30 October. We analyze continuous data from a dense network of 139 seismic stations to build a high‐precision catalog of ∼900,000 earthquakes spanning a 1 yr period, based on arrival times derived using a deep‐neural‐network‐based picker. Our catalog contains an order of magnitude more events than the catalog routinely produced by the local earthquake monitoring agency. Aftershock activity reveals the geometry of complex fault structures activated during the earthquake sequence and provides additional insights into the potential factors controlling the development of the largest events. Activated fault structures in the northern and southern regions appear complementary to faults activated during the 1997 Colfiorito and 2009 L’Aquila sequences, suggesting that earthquake triggering primarily occurs on critically stressed faults. Delineated major fault zones are relatively thick compared to estimated earthquake location uncertainties, and a large number of kilometer‐long faults and diffuse seismicity were activated during the sequence. These properties might be related to fault age, roughness, and the complexity of inherited structures. The rich details resolvable in this catalog will facilitate continued investigation of this energetic and well‐recorded earthquake sequence.},

We examine the ground motions recorded by 11 RS and one broadband station within 15 km of the United Downs Deep Geothermal Power (UDDGP) project in Cornwall, United Kingdom, to evaluate the RS network’s suitability to provide an initial ground‐motion assessment of the region. To date, the British Geological Survey (BGS) has reported 232 induced events originating at UDDGP since flow testing began in summer 2020, with two events exceeding local magnitude (ML) 1.5. Although the RS accelerometers are too noisy for UDDGP’s microseismic events, the vertical geophones are useful. Peak ground velocity observations are consistent with relevant ground‐motion models, whereas peak ground acceleration (PGA) values are greater than predicted. Regional trends in the PGA levels are likely caused by path effects. Finally, RS estimates of ML are similar to those reported by the BGS. For sparse national seismic networks, RS stations can enable a preliminary evaluation of seismic events and their ground motions.},

Where possible, MEMS were compared to the closest high‐quality seismic stations belonging to the national accelerometric network. The comparison, in terms of peak ground accelerations and spectral responses, confirms that the signals are in good agreement. The tested inexpensive MEMS sensors were able to detect small local events with epicentral distances as large as 50 km and provided an efficient characterization of the main motion parameters. This confirms that the proposed accelerometer prototypes are promising tools to integrate into traditional networks for local seismicity monitoring.},

We characterize faults beneath downtown SLC as active, and these faults may displace or deform the ground surface during an earthquake. Through offset but linked faults, our observations support throughgoing ruptures across faults of the Wasatch fault zone (WFZ) and an elevated risk of earthquake‐induced building damage.},

Vertical displacement estimates of faulted bedrock horizons, characteristics of bedrock structure (e.g., dip), potential association with dissolution of underlying Permian evaporite strata, and whether or not a postulated northeast extension of the topographic scarp is associated with Quaternary faulting have remained open questions. In this study, we assess six 2D seismic reflection profiles that cross the Cheraw fault scarp, demonstrate how Quaternary normal faulting has reactivated pre‐existing structures along the northwest flank of the Las Animas arch, and provide new constraints for seismic hazard characterization. We map the fault to depths of at least 1.5–1.8 km into lower Paleozoic strata in which the continuity of the fault through Permian evaporite indicates that dissolution of those stratigraphic intervals has no role in Quaternary surface faulting. Interpretation of the seismic data reveals an ∼75°±5° northwest‐dipping fault with ∼24–30  m vertical displacement of upper Cretaceous strata, which coincides with Quaternary scarps at the surface.},

Recent studies reported that seismic noise reduction caused by limited human activity due to the COVID‐19 lockdown had been observed with seismometers. However, it is difficult for the current seismic infrastructure in urban cities to characterize spatiotemporal seismic noise during the post‐COVID‐19 lockdown, because of their sparse distribution. Here, we show key connections between progressive COVID‐19 measures and spatiotemporal seismic noise changes recorded by a distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) array deployed in State College, Pennsylvania. We first show a spatiotemporal seismic noise reduction (up to 90\%) corresponding to reduced human activity in different city blocks during the stay‐at‐home period. We also show partial noise recovery corresponding to increased road traffic and industrial machinery in phase yellow and phase green of the lockdown. Nonrecovery seismic noise in the 0.01–10 Hz band suggests the low level of pedestrian movement during phase yellow and phase green. According to a linear correlation between Google mobility change and seismic noise change, we emphasize that DAS recordings using city‐wide fiber optics could provide a way for quantifying the impact of COVID‐19 measures on human activity in different blocks.},

The underlying cause of this dynamic triggering is still not well understood. One leading hypothesis is that a sudden increase in the fluid‐pore pressure in the fault zone is involved, but the exact physical mechanism is unclear. Here, we report experimental evidence in which a fluid‐filled fracture was shown to be able to amplify the pressure of an incoming seismic wave. We built miniature pressure sensors and directly placed them inside a thin fluid‐filled fracture to measure the fluid pressure during wave propagation. By varying the fracture aperture from 0.2 to 9.2 mm and sweeping the frequency from 12 to 70 Hz, we observed in the lab that the fluid pressure in the fracture could be amplified up to 25.2 times compared with the incident‐wave amplitude. Because an increase of the fluid pressure in a fault can reduce the effective normal stress to allow the fault to slide, our observed transient pressure surge phenomenon may provide the mechanism for earthquake dynamic triggering.},

Here, we examine unusual shell layers within a paleolagoon at Lake Grassmere, at the transition zone between the Hikurangi subduction zone and the Marlborough fault system. Based on biostratigraphic and sedimentological analyses, we interpret the shell layers as tsunami deposits. These are dated at 2145–1837 and 1505–1283 yr B.P., and the most likely source of these tsunamis was ruptures of the southern Hikurangi subduction interface. Identification of these two large earthquakes brings the total record of southern Hikurangi subduction earthquakes to four in the past 2000 yr. For the first time, it is possible to obtain a geologically constrained recurrence interval for the southern Hikurangi subduction zone. We calculate a recurrence interval of 500 yr (335–655 yr, 95\% confidence interval) and a coefficient of variation of 0.27 (0.0–0.47, 95\% confidence interval). The probability of a large subduction earthquake on the southern Hikurangi subduction zone is 26\% within the next 50 yr.

This area is the main focus of the Corinth Rift Laboratory (CRL) network, and has been closely monitored with local seismological and geodetic networks for 20 yr. The 2020–2021 seismic crisis evolved in three stages: It started with an Mw 4.6 event near the northern shore of the Gulf, opposite of Aigion, then migrated eastward toward Trizonia Island after an Mw 5.0 event, and eventually culminated with an Mw 5.3 event, ∼3  km northeast of the Psathopyrgos fault. Aftershocks gradually migrated westward, triggering another cluster near the junction with the Rion–Patras fault. Moment tensor inversion revealed mainly normal faulting; however, some strike‐slip mechanisms also exist, composing a complex tectonic regime in this region dominated by east–west normal faults. We employ seismic and geodetic observations to constrain the geometry and kinematics of the structures that hosted the major events. We discuss possible triggering mechanisms of the second and third stages of the sequence, including fluids migration and aseismic creep, and propose potential implications of the Mw 5.3 mainshock for the seismic hazard of the region.},

Limited knowledge of subsurface faults, the in situ geomechanical state, and the exact way in which petroleum operations have affected pore pressure (Pp) and stress state at depth makes causative assessment difficult, and the actions required for mitigation uncertain. To advance both goals, we integrate comprehensive regional fault interpretations, deterministic fault‐slip potential (DFSP), and multiple earthquake catalogs to assess specifically how faults of two systems—deeper basement‐rooted (BR) and shallow normal (SN)—can be made to slip as Pp is elevated. In their natural state, the overall population faults in both the systems have relatively stable DFSP, which explains the low earthquake rate prior to human inducement. BR faults with naturally unstable DFSP and associated earthquake sequences are few but include the Culberson–Mentone earthquake zone, which is near areas of wastewater injection into strata above basement. As a system, the SN faults in the southcentral Delaware basin are uniformly susceptible to slip with small increases in Pp. Many earthquakes sequences have occurred along these shallow faults in association with elevated Pp from shallow wastewater injection and hydraulic fracturing. Our new maps and methods can be used to better plan and regulate petroleum operations to avoid fault rupture.},

Although regional distance waveform‐based seismic moment tensor (MT) inversion methods successfully identify this event as an explosion, the inverted solutions do not fit the SAR displacement field well. To better constrain the source, we developed an MT source‐type inversion method that incorporates surface ground deformation (accounting for free‐surface topography), regional seismic waveforms, and first‐motion polarities. We applied the source‐type inversion over a grid of possible source locations to find the best‐fitting location, depth, and point‐source MT for the event. Our best‐fitting MT solution achieves ∼70\% horizontal geodetic fit, ∼80\% waveform fit, and 100\% fit in the first‐motion polarities. The joint inversion narrows the range of acceptable source types improving discrimination, and reduces the uncertainty in scalar moment and estimated yield. The method is transportable and can be applied to other types of events that may have measurable geodetic signals such as underground mine collapses and volcanic events.},

We develop a scheme to train neural operators on an ensemble of simulations performed with random velocity models and source locations. As neural operators are grid free, it is possible to evaluate solutions on higher resolution velocity models than trained on, providing additional computational efficiency. We illustrate the method with the 2D acoustic wave equation and demonstrate the method’s applicability to seismic tomography, using reverse‐mode automatic differentiation to compute gradients of the wavefield with respect to the velocity structure. The developed procedure is nearly an order of magnitude faster than using conventional numerical methods for full waveform inversion.},

    abstract = {Pinched between the Eastern Himalaya and the Indo‐Burman ranges, the Shillong Plateau represents a zone of distributed deformation with numerous visible and buried active faults. In 1897, a great (magnitude 8+) earthquake occurred in the area, and although a subsurface rupture plane has been proposed geodetically, its epicenter remained uncertain. We gathered original arrival time data of seismic waves from this early‐instrumental era and combined them with modern, 3D velocity models to constrain the origin time and epicenter of this event, including uncertainties. Our results show that the earthquake has taken place in the northwest part of the plateau, at the junction of the short, surface‐rupturing Chedrang fault and the buried Oldham fault (26.0°N, 90.7°E). This latter fault has been proposed earlier based on geodetic data and is long enough to host a great earthquake. Rupture has most likely propagated eastward. Stress change from the 1897 earthquake may have ultimately triggered the 1930 M 7.1 Dhubri earthquake, along a fault connecting the Shillong Plateau with the Himalaya.},

    abstract = {The Hikurangi subduction zone (HSZ) is the collisional boundary between the Pacific and Australian tectonic plates along the eastern coast of the North Island of New Zealand. The region is believed to be capable of hosting large megathrust earthquakes and associated tsunamis. Recent studies observe a range of slip behavior along the plate interface, with a sharp contrast between locked and creeping parts of the megathrust along the margin. This work uses teleseismic scattering data (receiver functions [RFs]) recorded at 53 long‐running seismograph stations on the North Island of New Zealand to constrain the structure and mechanical properties of the forearc in the HSZ. We observe directional variations in RF phases at P–S converted delay times (i.e., depths) associated with the overlying forearc crust and note a general correlation with spatial variations in plate coupling as well as other geophysical properties. Our results suggest differences in the nature of crustal deformation (and stress state) along the Hikurangi margin, with evidence of clockwise rotation and/or extension in the northern HSZ, where the overriding forearc crust is uncoupled from the subducting Pacific slab.},

    abstract = {On 10 February 2021, an Mw 7.7 thrust earthquake ruptured the megathrust along the southeast Loyalty Islands within the strong bend in the plate boundary between the Australian plate and the North Fiji basin. The mainshock involved rupture with ∼50 s duration, with pure thrust slip concentrated in an east–west‐trending slip patch with up to 4.2 m of slip extending from 10 to 25 km depth. Slip at depths \&lt;10 km is negligible on the curved fault surface, which conforms to the SLAB2 interface model. Static stress‐drop estimates are ∼5.5 MPa, and the radiated energy is 2.38×1015  J, with the moment‐scaled value of 5.7×10−6. The relatively shallow rupture from 10 to 25 km was moderately efficient in generating tsunami, with waves amplitudes up to 20 cm recorded in New Caledonia, New Zealand, Kermadec, and Fiji. Numerous M5+ normal‐faulting aftershocks occur south of the trench, indicating effective stress change transfer from the megathrust to the bending flange of the Australian plate that is negotiating the bend in the trench. Highly productive sequences involving paired thrust and normal faulting have repeatedly occurred westward along the northwest‐trending portion of the Loyalty Islands region, also indicating unusually efficient stress communication.},

Bolides are also important atmospheric sources for assessing long‐range infrasound propagation models and can be used as benchmark events for validating the International Monitoring System (IMS) infrasound network, which is designed to detect nuclear tests in the atmosphere. This article exploits unique infrasound observations from a large bolide recorded on IMS infrasound arrays and high‐density infrasound deployments in the United States to assess limitations in infrasound source scaling relationships. The observations provide an unprecedented sampling of infrasound propagation along a transect at an azimuth of 60° from the source to a distance of ∼8000 km. Widely used empirical laws for assessing bolide energetics and state‐of‐the‐art numerical models for simulating infrasound propagation are assessed to quantify important discrepancies with the observations. In particular, empirical laws for equivalent yield, which are based on signal period and are assumed to be relatively unaffected by propagation effects, can be heavily contaminated by site noise. In addition, by modeling infrasound propagation over a range of ∼8000 km, we show that state‐of‐the‐art models do not reproduce the observed amplitude decay over this long range (which decays by a rate of at least 2 higher than can be modeled).},

Explosion source time functions estimated by previous modeling efforts are deconvolved from the broadband Pn observations to extract direct estimates of the Pn Green’s functions. Very consistent signals are found for station MDJ (to the north) for all but the 2006 event, and a 1D layered elastic model is determined that matches the corresponding pPn signals for the larger events. The much simpler Pn Green’s functions found for INCN (to the south) are well modeled using a half‐space structure. The 1D structures are incorporated into intercorrelations for teleseismic P observations. Very similar results are found using the layered MDJ model for all azimuths, or when azimuthally varying the source velocity model to have a half‐space structure for stations to the south, and/or using a half‐space structure for the 2006 event at all azimuths. The relative yield estimates from intercorrelation are thus stable with respect to specific 1D source structures; the full effects of 3D elastic and nonelastic structures are yet to be considered.},

The aftershock pattern defines a nearly north‐striking, 50° east‐dipping fault plane. We find a unilateral rupture along this fault plane propagating southward and updip with predominantly normal slip up to ∼1.5 m. The estimated seismic moment of 8.47×1017  N·m is equivalent to Mw 5.92. A finite‐source inversion that retains seismic waveforms and GPS static offsets but omits InSAR range changes yields a seismic moment of 1.08×1018  N·m (Mw 5.99). Despite vigorous aftershock activity between 10 km and Earth’s surface, coseismic slip is concentrated in the depth interval 7–10 km.},

Detailed and accurate spatial distribution of seismicity and focal mechanisms are critical components for understanding the underlying industrial processes responsible for inducing seismicity. We focus on a highly seismically active area straddling the Reeves–Pecos County line where two TexNet stations sit atop the seismicity, which includes 21 ML 3+ events from 2017 to 2020 (Advanced National Seismic System Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog). Short epicentral distance enables us to reliably estimate the hypocentral depth using seismic phase picks and standard location methods. We use a deep‐learning‐based method to detect earthquakes and time the phase arrivals. Hypocentral locations computed in a velocity model constrained by local well data reveal that the seismicity concentrates between 1.5 and 2.5 km below ground in the Delaware Mountain Group, the primary wastewater disposal zone at this location. Waveform inversions for the moment tensor and focal depth independently confirm the shallow depths. The moment tensor solutions define critically stressed high‐angle normal faults, suggesting a causal connection between injection and seismicity.},

We do not find any effect of the pumping rate or volume injected in the changes in velocity. However, the induced earthquakes’ ground motions are associated with an extreme reduction in seismic velocities. The magnitude of the changes surpasses ten times the values typically found in other earthquake settings. Our full‐waveform investigation suggests that the changes mainly occurred around the top of the Ozark aquifer.

Earthquake P arrivals show rapid changes in waveform characteristics over 20–40 m zones that coincide with the surface BF and MCF. These variations indicate that the BF and MCF are high‐impedance contrast interfaces—an observation supported by the presence of seismic reflections. Another prominent but more diffuse change in SSAF structure is found ∼1 km northeast of the BF. This feature has average‐to‐low arrival times (P and S) and ambient noise levels (at \&lt;30 Hz), and likely represents a relatively fast velocity block sandwiched between broader MCF and BF zones. The maximal arrival delays (P ∼0.1 s and S ∼0.25 s) and the highest ambient noise levels (\&gt;2 times median) are consistently observed southwest of the BF—a combined effect of Coachella Valley sediments and rock damage on that side. Immediately northeast of the MCF, large S minus P delays suggest a broad high VP/VS zone associated with asymmetric rock damage across the SSAF. This general overview shows the BF and MCF as mature but distinctly different fault zones. Future analyses will further clarify these and other SSAF features in greater detail.},

Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s Advanced Land Observing Satellite #2 (ALOS2) satellite, reveal a deformation field that is more complex than expected from a single reverse fault earthquake. The data also reveal an apparent fault rupture at the Earth’s surface that caused damage to local roads. Modeling of the InSAR deformation field indicates the fault rupture is associated with a very shallow normal faulting event with an equivalent Mw of about 5.1 that overprinted the reverse fault deformation field and possibly occurred aseismically.},

The low stress drop Airport events occurred shortly after the initiation of injection near a fault within hundreds of meters of the well. Pore pressure perturbations in the Airport area are 1 order of magnitude lower than those from the other sequences, suggesting that absolute pore pressure changes may not be the main factors of stress drop variations. We suggest that the low stress drop events may be related to transition from aseismic slip to seismic rupture previously observed in laboratory and field experiments.},

Normal‐mode observations can provide information about the radial density and anisotropic velocity structure of the Earth (including near the core–mantle boundary), but only when signal‐to‐noise ratios at very low frequencies are sufficiently high. Most normal‐mode observations in the past three decades have been made using Streckeisen STS‐1 vault seismometers. However, these sensors are no longer being manufactured or serviced. Candidate replacement sensors, the Streckeisen STS‐6 and the Nanometrics T‐360GSN, have been recently installed in boreholes, postholes, and vaults at several GSN stations and GSN testbeds. In this study, we examine normal‐mode spectra following three Mw 8 earthquakes in 2021 and from one Mw 8.2 earthquake in 2014 to evaluate the change in GSN low‐frequency performance on the vertical component. From this analysis, we conclude that the number of GSN stations capable of resolving normal modes following Mw 8 earthquakes has nearly doubled since 2014. The improved observational capabilities will help better understand the radial velocity and density estimates of the Earth.},

Although by October 2021, the Mars seismic catalog included 951 events, until recently all these events have been assessed as lying within a radius of 100° of InSight. Here we report two distant events that occurred within days of each other, located on the far side of Mars, giving us our first glimpse into Mars’ core shadow zone. The first event, recorded on 25 August 2021 (InSight sol 976), shows clear polarized arrivals that we interpret to be PP and SS phases at low frequencies and locates to Valles Marineris, 146° ± 7° from InSight. The second event, occurring on 18 September 2021 (sol 1000), has significantly more broadband energy with emergent PP and SS arrivals, and a weak phase arriving before PP that we interpret as Pdiff. Considering uncertain pick times and poorly constrained travel times for Pdiff, we estimate this event is at a distance between 107° and 147° from InSight. With magnitudes of MwMa 4.2 and 4.1, respectively, these are the largest seismic events recorded so far on Mars.},

    abstract = {The clearest statistical signal in aftershock locations is that most aftershocks occur close to their mainshocks. More precisely, aftershocks are triggered at distances following a power‐law decay in distance (Felzer and Brodsky, 2006). This distance decay kernel is used in epidemic‐type aftershock sequence (ETAS) modeling and is typically assumed to be isotropic, even though individual sequences show more clustered aftershock occurrence. The assumption of spatially isotropic triggering kernels can impact the estimation of ETAS parameters themselves, such as biasing the magnitude‐productivity term, alpha, and assigning too much weight to secondary rather than primary (direct) triggering. Here we show that aftershock locations in southern California, at all mainshock–aftershock distances, preferentially occur in the areas of previous seismicity. For a given sequence, the scaling between aftershock rates and the previous seismicity rate is approximately linear. However, the total number of aftershocks observed for a given sequence is independent of background rate. We explain both of these observations within the framework of rate‐and‐state friction (Dieterich, 1994).},

    abstract = {The Mw 4.9 Offshore Jeju Island, Korea, earthquake of 14 December 2021 is the most significant event that occurred close to the young intraplate volcano on the continental shelf south of the Korean Peninsula. About 185 small earthquakes occurred during nine days following the mainshock. We accurately located 39 events despite limited station azimuthal coverage. We found that the mainshock ruptured along a ∼1.4 km long fault striking east–west (275°) and triggered two distinct clusters in the north–northeast direction. The mainshock is pure strike‐slip faulting on the vertical plane. Its horizontal P axis strikes 50°, which differs substantially from the average trend of ∼70° for earthquakes in the southern Korean Peninsula. However, it is consistent with the P‐axes orientation of shallow earthquakes in the offshore western Kyushu and along Okinawa trough. The 2021 Offshore Jeju Island earthquake may be the first significant earthquake in southern Korea–East China Sea continental shelf to date, whose causative fault is well constrained by accurate aftershock locations and detailed space–time analysis of the earthquake sequence. This earthquake may represent intraplate deformation in response to the tectonic evolution of the Philippine Sea plate, which is manifested through volcanic activities.},

    abstract = {Focal mechanisms, which reflect the sense of slip in earthquakes, provide important constraints for understanding crustal tectonics and earthquake source physics, including the interactions among earthquakes during mainshock–aftershock sequences or seismic swarms. Focal mechanisms of small (magnitude ≲3.5) earthquakes are usually determined by first‐motion P‐wave polarities, sometimes supplemented by the ratio of S‐wave to P‐wave amplitudes (S/P). However, focal mechanisms of such events can be difficult to reliably constrain, particularly with sparse recording networks or very small magnitude events. Here, we describe a method for deriving S/P amplitude ratios from P/P and S/S amplitude ratios measured on single seismic components between pairs of nearby events, as is often performed during correlation‐based earthquake detection and relocation. These measurements can be transformed into relative S/P amplitude ratios, or they can be combined with a smaller number of traditional S/P amplitude ratios to provide a single‐channel estimation of full S/P ratios, even for low signal‐to‐noise‐ratio events not routinely cataloged and not amenable to traditional S/P ratio processing. This approach has the potential to greatly expand the applicability of S/P amplitude ratios, providing additional constraints for focal mechanisms of small earthquakes, particularly for spatially concentrated seismicity sequences.},

We investigate signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) at regional and global stations, and find the best signals in central Asia and Alaska. Lower SNR at stations in China, Europe, and Australia is likely related to the radiation pattern. A joint probabilistic location of the 2022 event and well‐constrained historical nuclear tests indicates an epicenter near 41.88° N and 88.10° E, about 25 km northwest of the tunnel portion of the test site. A moment tensor inversion using high‐quality regional signals indicates a nearly deviatoric source with a 72\% double couple and a reverse fault mechanism. The centroid depth is 20–25 km, consistent with depth phases recorded in Alaska. The observed faulting geometry and source composition for the 2022 Lop Nor event is consistent with previous earthquakes in the region and the spatial alignment of local geomorphological features, indicating tectonic and not anthropogenic origin.},

Because Rayleigh wave ellipticity features outstanding shallow sensitivity, we invert for a 3D upper crust VS model of the Salt Lake Valley. Our model shows basin structure in general agreement with and complements the current Community Velocity Model, which is mostly constrained by borehole and gravity measurements. Our model thus provides critical information for future earthquake hazard assessment studies, which require detailed shallow velocity structure.},

Here we demonstrate that fiber‐optic sensing technology deployed on a natural floating ice resonator can detect volcanic tremor at the level of few nanostrain/s, thereby enabling a new mode of subglacial volcano monitoring under harsh conditions. A 12.5 km long fiber‐optic cable deployed on Grímsvötn in May 2021 revealed a high level of local earthquake activity, superimposed onto nearly monochromatic oscillations of the caldera. High data quality combined with dense spatial sampling identify these oscillations as flexural gravity wave resonance of the ice sheet that floats atop a subglacial lake. Although being affected by the ambient wavefield, the time–frequency characteristics of observed caldera resonance require the presence of an additional persistent driving force with temporal variations over several days, that is most plausibly explained in terms of low‐frequency volcanic tremor. In addition to demonstrating the logistical feasibility of installing a large, high‐quality fiber‐optic sensing network in a subarctic environment, our experiment shows that ice sheet resonance may act as a natural amplifier of otherwise undetectable (volcanic) signals. This suggests that similar resonators might be used in a targeted fashion to improve monitoring of ice‐covered volcanic systems.},

    abstract = {Thousands of rock arches are situated within the central Colorado Plateau—a region experiencing small‐ to moderate‐magnitude contemporary seismicity. Recent anthropogenic activity has substantially increased the seismicity rate in some areas, raising questions about the potential for vibration damage of natural arches, many of which have high cultural value. However, predictions of the vibration response and potential for damage at a given site are limited by a lack of data describing spectral amplification of ground motion on these landforms. We analyzed 13 sandstone arches in Utah, computing site‐to‐reference spectral amplitude ratios from continuous ambient seismic data, and compared these to spectral ratios during earthquakes and teleseismic activity. We found peak ground velocities on arches at their dominant natural modes (in the range of 2–20 Hz) are ∼20–180 times the velocity on adjacent bedrock, due to amplification arising from slender geometry and low modal damping (0.8\%–2.7\%). Ambient spectral ratios are generally 1.2–2.0 times the coseismic spectral ratios. Because arches experience highly amplified ground motion, the range of earthquakes considered potentially damaging may need to be revised to include lower‐magnitude events. Our results have implications for conservation management of these and other culturally valuable landforms.},

We use a double‐difference method to relocate the hypocenters of the mainshock and aftershocks, determine focal mechanisms using waveform inversion, and then analyze stress changes to estimate the fault type and stress transfer. Our relocated hypocenters show that this earthquake sequence ruptured on at least three segments: the source mechanism of the mainshock exhibits dextral strike‐slip motion (strike N72°W and dip 78° NE) on a west–east‐trending fault that we call the Kalaotoa fault, whereas rupture of the other two segments located to the west and east of the mainshock (striking west‐northwest and southeast, respectively) may have been triggered by this earthquake. The Coulomb stress change imparted by the rupture of these segments on nearby faults is investigated, with a focus on regions that experience a stress increase with few associated aftershocks. Of particular interest are stress increases on the central back‐arc thrust just north of Flores and the north–south‐striking Selayar fault in the northwest of our study region, both of which may be at increased risk of failure as a result of this unusual earthquake sequence.},

Our results introduce the notion of compatibility as a consideration by showing that the same basin models embedded into two different regional models can produce notably different outcomes. In contrast to most of our hybrid Harvard models that produce better matching ground motions, only one of the hybrid models generated using the Southern California Earthquake Center model as a regional model gives a closer match to the waveforms. Similar results are obtained at higher frequencies; however, improvements due to hybridization are reduced. A potential explanation for these results may be the limited high spatial frequencies in the travel time tomography basin models and the \&gt;5–6 s wavefield‐dominated adjoint regional models. Although the strongly tapered compatible hybrid models tend to produce better results, we find instances of improvements even with merging artifacts.},

The modest natural seismicity and incomplete knowledge of the fault network in the region made it difficult to anticipate the locations of earthquakes with larger magnitudes (Mw≥4). Here, we show that monitoring of microearthquakes at regional scale using a pretrained neural phase picker and an earthquake relocation algorithm can illuminate unknown fault structures, and deliver information that can be synthesized for earthquake forecasting. We found that 80\% of the larger earthquakes that occurred in the past decade could have been anticipated based on the spatial extent of the seismicity clusters that were formed before these earthquakes occurred. We also found that once a seismicity cluster with a length scale enough to host a larger earthquake was formed, there was a ∼5\% chance that it would host one or more larger earthquakes within a year. This probability is nearly an order of magnitude higher than one based on Gutenberg–Richter statistics and preceding seismicity. Applying our approach in practice can provide critical information on seismic hazards for risk management and regulatory decision making.},

    abstract = {For decades there has been a debate about the relative effects of dynamic versus static stress triggering of aftershocks. According to the static Coulomb stress change hypothesis, aftershocks should not occur in stress shadows—regions where static Coulomb stress has been reduced. We show that static stress shadows substantially influence aftershock occurrence following three M ≥ 7 California mainshocks. Within the modeled static Coulomb stress shadows, the aftershock rate is an order of magnitude lower than in the modeled increase regions. However, the earthquake rate in the stress shadows does not decrease below the background rate, as predicted by Coulomb stress change models. Aftershocks in the stress shadows exhibit different spatial–temporal characteristics from aftershocks in the stress increase regions. The aftershock rate in the stress shadows decays as a power law with distance from the mainshock, consistent with a simple model of dynamic stress triggering. These aftershocks begin with a burst of activity during the first few days after the mainshock, also consistent with dynamic stress triggering. Our interpretation is that aftershock sequences are the combined result of static and dynamic stress triggering, with an estimated ∼34\% of aftershocks due to dynamic triggering and ∼66\% due to static triggering.},

By comparing inversion results for the eruption with eight nearby earthquakes, we show that it is possible to discriminate MT source types. Our inversion yields a shallow explosive source for the eruption and reveals the importance of trade‐offs among depth, magnitude, and source type. We illustrate these trade‐offs by representing the misfit variations over the eigenvalue lune. Finally, we invert for the source‐time function of the sequence of explosions that occurred in the first minutes of the eruption.

Recent studies revealed that a substantial percentage of small‐sized earthquakes (M\&lt;∼5) display rupture directivity as well, owing to enhanced seismic monitoring. Is rupture directivity a common feature for earthquakes of all sizes? In this study, we investigated the rupture directivity of the 27 August 2021 ML 2.2 Gwangyang microearthquake that occurred at the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula by utilizing data from a recently expanded dense seismic network. The mainshock had two foreshocks and three aftershocks, which enabled us to define the fault plane from precise relative event locations and a well‐constrained focal mechanism. Analysis of apparent source time functions obtained with the empirical Green’s function technique reveals that the mainshock ruptured unilaterally toward the east. A detailed analysis of the source pulse leaving the focal sphere in 3D indicates that rupture directivity is consistent with the fault geometry and slip direction. Our study demonstrates that we can resolve rupture directivity of unilaterally rupturing microearthquakes (M\&lt;∼3) given adequate azimuthal coverage, and that this will lead to an improved understanding of the seismogenic processes in regions of low seismicity worldwide.},

    abstract = {Since 2001, the Southern California Seismic Network has archived continuous waveform data from strong‐motion station CI.MIK in Caltech Hall (formerly Millikan Library)—a nine‐story reinforced concrete building. Simple spectral analysis of this 20 yr record reveals that the building’s fundamental frequencies have increased gradually by 5.1\% (east–west) and 2.3\% (north–south), with larger long‐term variability up to 9.7\% (east–west) and 4.4\% (north–south). This finding is unexpected, as previous analysis of forced vibration tests and strong‐motion records has shown that between 1968 and 2003 the fundamental frequencies decreased by 22\% (east–west) and 12\% (north–south), largely attributed to minor structural damage and soil–structure system changes from major earthquakes. Today, the building’s apparent structural stiffness is comparable to what it was in 1986, before the Whittier Narrows earthquake. Using data from earthquakes and forced vibrations, we also document the building’s nonlinear dynamic elasticity, which is characterized by a rapid softening (decrease in apparent frequencies) at the onset of strong motion, followed by a slower, log–linear recovery trend over the scale of minutes. This nonlinear behavior does not appear to have changed with time.},

However, the locations and geometries of individual faults in the Great Valley fault system are poorly constrained, and fault slip rates and paleoearthquake chronology are largely unknown. Here, we report geomorphic and subsurface geophysical evidence of surface‐deforming displacement on a strand of the Great Valley fault system west of Winters, California. Detailed geomorphic mapping and a high‐resolution seismic reflection and tomography survey along an ∼800 m profile across the Bigelow Hills document a fault, which we call the West Winters strand of the Great Valley fault system, with apparent east side‐up displacement of surficial geologic units. These data together suggest that the West Winters strand is active in the latest Quaternary. Together with local reports from the time, this raises the possibility that the West Winters strand may have ruptured and deformed the surface during the 1892 M 6 Vacaville–Winters earthquake sequence. Future earthquakes with vertical displacement on this and Great Valley fault system structures could have significant hazard implications, given the region’s low relief and the presence of major water conveyance infrastructure.},

Whereas conventional seismometers can be used to measure the translational components of normal modes, recent advances in rotational seismometer technology now allow direct measurement of the rotational components. We deployed a portable, three‐component rotational seismometer for a short‐duration experiment on a 36 m high sandstone tower located near Moab, Utah, in addition to conducting modal analysis using conventional seismic data and numerical modeling. Spectral analysis of rotation rate data resolved the first three natural frequencies of the tower (2.1, 3.1, and 5.9 Hz), and polarization analysis revealed the orientations of the rotation axes. Modal rotations were the strongest for the first two eigenmodes, which are mutually perpendicular, full‐height bending modes with horizontal axes of rotation. The third mode is torsional with rotation about a subvertical axis. Measured natural frequencies and the orientations of displacements and rotation axes match our numerical models closely for these first three modes. In situ measurements of modal rotations are valuable at remote field sites with limited access, and contribute to an improved understanding of modal deformation, material properties, and landform response to vibration stimuli.},

    abstract = {We study stress‐loading mechanisms for the California faults used in rupture forecasts. Stress accumulation drives earthquakes, and that accumulation mechanism governs recurrence. Most moment release in California occurs because of relative motion between the Pacific plate and the Sierra Nevada block; we calculate relative motion directions at fault centers and compare with fault displacement directions. Dot products between these vectors reveal that some displacement directions are poorly aligned with plate motions. We displace a 3D finite‐element model according to relative motions and resolve stress tensors onto defined fault surfaces, which reveal that poorly aligned faults receive no tectonic loading. Because these faults are known to be active, we search for other loading mechanisms. We find that nearly all faults with no tectonic loading show increase in stress caused by slip on the San Andreas fault, according to an elastic dislocation model. Globally, faults that receive a sudden stress change respond with triggered earthquakes that obey an Omori law rate decay with time. We therefore term this class of faults as “aftershock faults.” These faults release ∼4\% of the moment release in California, have ∼0.1\%–5\% probability of M 6.7 earthquakes in 30 yr, and have a 0.001\%–1\% 30 yr M 7.7 probability range.},

In addition, we model uniform and vertically localized velocity perturbations, and measure the velocity change with 1D synthetic seismograms. Our results indicate that our methods underestimate the known velocity change, especially at shorter station distances and when variations are restricted to a horizontal layer. If injection does cause measurable velocity changes, its effect is likely diluted in cross correlations due to its localized spatial extent around injection wells.},

We consider our method as an inexpensive addition to the pool of earthquake impact assessment tools, one that is fully independent of seismic data and can be utilized in many populated areas on the planet. Although practical deployment of our method remains an open task, we demonstrate the potential to improve disaster management in regions that currently lack expensive seismic instrumentation.},

We observe that the largest earthquake (M 4.4) occurred where there is significant fault complexity and the highest measured roughness. We also find that b‐values are weakly positively correlated with fault roughness. Following the largest earthquake, we observe a distinct population of earthquakes with comparatively low b‐values occurring in an area of high roughness within the rupture area of the M 4.4 earthquake. Finally, we measure roughness at multiple scales and find that the fault is self‐affine with a Hurst exponent of 0.52, consistent with a Brownian surface.},

    abstract = {Shear waves play a key role in seismic discrimination between explosions and earthquakes due to their different source mechanisms. However, shear waves are often observed in field explosions with unexpectedly large amplitude, and their generation mechanism is still a significant unresolved question in seismology. Many explanations have been proposed, including the asymmetry of explosive sources, and heterogeneity and/or anisotropy of the Earth’s subsurface. However, it has not been well understood whether source or velocity structure can independently and sufficiently explain the shear waves generated by explosions. Theoretically, tangential SH waves can be converted and scattered from vertical and radial SV waves due to anisotropy and heterogeneity. Thus, it is essential to understand the generation of SV waves by explosions. In this study, we utilize the frequency–wavenumber algorithm and 1D layered velocity models to simulate waveforms of isotropic explosions and double‐couple earthquakes at local distances (\&lt;20 km). Our results suggest that explosions and earthquakes may generate comparable SV waves if both occurred within a near‐surface velocity gradient zone. The earliest SV waves by explosions appear to originate from the near‐source region. It implies that P/SV amplitude ratios of explosions and earthquakes could be indistinguishable under certain circumstances.},

A slip model is obtained that satisfactorily explains geodetic, teleseismic, and tsunami observations of the 2022 event. The preferred model has a compact large‐slip patch that extends up‐dip and northwestward from the hypocenter and directly overlaps a 1973 Mw 7.6 rupture. Slip is concentrated offshore and below the coast at depths from 10 to 30 km with a peak value of ∼2.9 m, and there is no detected coseismic slip near the trench. The total seismic moment is 3.1×1020  N·m (Mw 7.6), 72\% of which is concentrated in the first 30 s. Most aftershocks are distributed in an up‐dip area of the mainshock that has small coseismic slip, suggesting near‐complete strain release in the large‐slip patch. Teleseismic P waveforms of the 2022 and 1973 earthquakes are similar in duration and complexity with high cross‐correlation coefficients of 0.68–0.98 for long P to PP signal time windows, indicating that the 2022 earthquake is a quasi‐repeat of the 1973 earthquake, possibly indicating persistent frictional properties. Both the events produced more complex P waveforms than comparable size events along Guerrero and Oaxaca, reflecting differences in patchy locking of the Mexican megathrust.},

These simulations can help diagnose past earthquake behavior and are also used to generate scenarios of possible future earthquakes. Traditional dynamic rupture models generally assume elastic rock response, but this can lead to peak on‐fault slip rates and ground shaking that are higher than those inferred from seismological observations. Some have approached this challenge using inelastic off‐fault rock behavior to dissipate energy, but the addition of inelasticity can make it difficult to select parameters and establish suitable initial conditions, and increases the model’s complexity and computational cost. We propose a new method that works by adding a nonlinear radiation damping term to the friction law, with the surrounding rocks remaining linear elastic. Our new method results in lower peak slip rates, reduced seismic radiation, and an increasing slip‐weakening critical distance with increasing rupture propagation distance, all within a linear elastic model. In addition, it is easy to implement.},

An implicit assumption is that the comparatively higher spatiotemporal resolution datasets from which regional models are generated lead to more informative seismicity forecasts than global models, which are however calibrated on greater datasets of large earthquakes. Here, we prospectively assess the ability of the Global Earthquake Activity Rate (GEAR1) model and 19 time‐independent regional models to forecast M 4.95+ seismicity in California, New Zealand, and Italy from 2014 through 2021, using metrics developed by the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP). Our results show that regional models that adaptively smooth small earthquake locations perform best in California and Italy during the evaluation period; however, GEAR1, based on global seismicity and geodesy datasets, performs surprisingly well across all testing regions, ranking first in New Zealand, second in California, and third in Italy. Furthermore, the performance of the models is highly sensitive to spatial smoothing, and the optimal smoothing likely depends on the regional tectonic setting. Acknowledging the limited prospective test data, these results provide preliminary support for using GEAR1 as a global reference M 4.95+ seismicity model that could inform eight‐year regional and global PSHAs.},

The depth of mantle discontinuities is usually estimated using the differential travel time between the main arrival and its precursor. However, this method ignores potential travel path deviations that influence the travel time of precursor signals. Here, we use an approach that considers directivity information as well as travel‐time measurements. Applying seismic array techniques, we measure slowness, back azimuth, and travel time of the signals, and use this information to backproject to the point of reflection. In our test dataset, we observe deviations from the predicted values in slowness and back azimuth in the range of 0.1–2.3 s/° and 1–20°, respectively. These values lead to reflection locations that can differ considerably from theoretical reflection points calculated with great circle plane paths as well as depths different from the depth calculated for in‐plane propagation, with differences up to ∼150 km. Our results indicate that the travel‐path deviations should be considered to avoid misinterpretation of mantle discontinuities and potentially reduce previously observed scatter in discontinuity depth.},

    abstract = {On 6 February 2023, two large earthquakes with magnitude 7.8 and 7.6 rocked south‐central Türkiye and northwestern Syria. At the time of writing, the death toll exceeded 50,000 in Türkiye and 7200 in Syria. The epicenter of the first mainshock was located ∼15 km east of the east Anatolian fault (EAF), the second large earthquake (9 hr later) initiated ∼90 km to the north on the east–west‐trending Sürgü fault. Aftershocks delineate fault lengths of ∼350 and ∼170 km, respectively. Using satellite and seismic data for first‐order analyses of surface‐fault offsets, space–time rupture evolution, and recorded ground motions, our study sheds light on the reasons for the extensive destruction. The first event ruptured the EAF bilaterally, lasted for ∼80 s, and created surface fault offsets of over 6 m. The second event also ruptured bilaterally with a duration of ∼35 s and more than 7 m surface offsets. Horizontal ground accelerations reached locally up to 2g in the first mainshock; severe and widespread shaking occurred in the Hatay‐Antakia area with values near 0.5g. Both earthquakes are characterized by directivity effects and abrupt rupture cessation generating stopping phases that contributed to strong seismic radiation. Shaking was further aggravated locally by site‐amplification effects.},

    abstract = {High‐resolution passive seismic imaging of shallow subsurface structures is often challenged by the scarcity of coherent body‐wave energy in ambient noise recorded at surface stations. We show that the autocorrelation (AC) of teleseismic P‐wave coda extracted from just one month of continuous recording at 5 Hz geophones can overcome this limitation. We apply this method to investigate the longitudinal subsurface bedrock structure of Unaweep Canyon—a paleovalley in western Colorado (United States) with complex evolution. Both fluvial and glacial processes have been proposed to explain the canyon’s genesis and morphology. The teleseismic P‐wave coda AC retrieves zero‐offset reflections from the shallow (200–500 m depth) basement interface at 120 stations along a 5 km long profile. In addition, we invert interferometrically retrieved surface‐wave dispersion for the shear‐wave structure of the sedimentary fill. Combined interpretation of these results and other geophysical and well data suggests an overdeepened basement geometry most consistent with glacial processes.},

    abstract = {We present distributed fiber‐optic sensing data from an airplane landing near the EastGRIP ice core drilling site on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream. The recordings of exceptional clarity contain at least 15 easily visible wave propagation modes corresponding to various Rayleigh, pseudoacoustic, and leaky waves. In the frequency range from 8 to 55 Hz, seven of the modes can be identified unambiguously. Based on an a priori firn and ice model that matches P‐wave dispersion and the fundamental Rayleigh mode, a Backus–Gilbert inversion yields an S‐wavespeed model with resolution lengths as low as a few meters and uncertainties in the range of only 10 m/s. An empirical scaling from S wavespeed to density leads to a depth estimate of the firn–ice transition between 65 and 71 m, in agreement with direct firn core measurements. This work underlines the potential of distributed fiber‐optic sensing combined with strong unconventional seismic sources in studies of firn and ice properties, which are critical ingredients of ice core climatology, as well as ice sheet dynamics and mass balance calculations.},

The earthquake sequence caused widespread damage and tens of thousands of casualties in Türkiye and Syria. We analyze mainshocks and aftershocks, combining complementary source characterization techniques, relying on local, regional, and teleseismic data. Backprojection analysis and finite source inversion for the mainshocks resolve coseismic slip, rupture length, and propagation mode along the main faults, whereas centroid moment tensor inversion for 221 aftershocks resolves details of the fault network. The first mainshock nucleated on a splay fault and activated the neighboring East Anatolian fault zone (EAFZ). It ruptured bilaterally along ∼500 km first toward northeast and later to south‐southwest on multiple, previously partly dormant fault segments. The second mainshock ruptured the east–west‐oriented Sürgü‐Misis fault zone (SMFZ), reaching a slip of 7 m. The analysis of aftershocks with heterogeneous moment tensors retrospectively reconstructs rupture details. Along the main strand of the EAFZ, they map the geometry of different segments in unprecedented detail, whereas along the SMFZ they illuminate the geometry and behavior of large structures for the first time. Our work sheds light on multiple aspects of rupture evolution and provides new insights into the devastating earthquake sequence.},

Peak ground accelerations (PGAs) and peak ground velocities (PGVs) are notably higher to the southeast, with an order of magnitude difference for stations at the same distance but different azimuths. In addition, PGAs are lower than that predicted by ground‐motion models by a factor of 3 on average in all the directions, indicating a low stress drop (∼1.57 MPa). Directivity function modeling and ground‐motion simulations both indicate rupture propagation to the southeast with rupture velocity between 2.3 and 2.5 km/s. We suggest that the southward rupture propagation and relatively low stress drop may be typical of M ∼5 earthquakes on this portion of the CCF.},

The U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) provides real‐time monitoring of earthquakes globally, including rapid source characterization and impact estimates. Here, we describe the seismic characterization products generated and made available by the NEIC over the two weeks following the start of the earthquake sequence in southeast Türkiye, their evolution, and how they inform our understanding of regional seismotectonics and hazards. The kinematics of rupture for the two earthquakes was complex, involving multiple fault segments. Therefore, incorporating observations from rupture mapping was critical for characterizing these events. Dense local datasets facilitated robust source characterization and impact assessment once these observations were obtained and converted to NEIC product input formats. We discuss how we may improve the timeliness of NEIC products for rapid assessment of future seismic hazards, particularly in the case of complex ruptures.},

For historical and early instrumental earthquakes, similar results and products are developed depending on data availability and event significance, drawing from published later studies. The year 2023 marked the ninetieth anniversary of the 11 March 1933 Long Beach, California, earthquake. This anniversary provided the impetus to update ANSS products, drawing on archived and published data. Here, we describe the updated ShakeMap, shaking recordings and intensities, and retrospective aftershock forecast for the Long Beach, California, earthquake. In effect we have developed standard, modern ANSS products for an earthquake that occurred 90 yr ago. Our results show that the distributions of both the ground motions, anchored by three strong‐motion recordings, and aftershock magnitudes are consistent with expectations for an M 6.4 mainshock in Southern California. We show that, notwithstanding possible limitations, instrumentally recorded accelerations from the closest station are consistent with predicted shaking and directly estimated macroseismic intensities. Updated data products have been added to the USGS event page, where they are available for download. Public‐facing products were also created for the anniversary and are freely available on the USGS website.},

The 1989 Mw 7.0 Loma Prieta earthquake illustrated that reverse‐oblique slip on a transpressive segment of the predominantly horizontal slip San Andreas transform fault produces coastal uplift. In west‐central California the 400 km long San Gregorio‐Hosgri coastal fault system of near‐vertical to steeply northeast‐dipping, reverse‐oblique, dextral strike‐slip faults also contribute to coastal uplift. Published southern Hosgri fault dextral slip rates are ∼4× reverse rates. Viscoelastic deformation modeling using published transpressional slip rates along the southern Hosgri fault reproduces observed emergent marine terrace uplift rates, offshore Hosgri fault deformation morphology, and crustal structure from San Luis Obispo Bay to Estero Bay. Our coastal uplift rate modeling is constrained by a unique combination of measurements: (1) offshore reverse‐ and strike‐slip Hosgri fault zone (HFZ) slip rates, and (2) ≤125 ka onshore emergent terrace uplift rates adjacent to the HFZ. The previously proposed conceptual rigid block models of the southern central California coast (CCC) invoke local onshore thrust or reverse faults to explain coastal uplift. Observed transpressional offshore Hosgri fault deformation rates alone rigorously reproduce observed coastal uplift rates and crustal structure along the southern CCC.},

Data are analyzed for two weeks: one in July 2021 and another in November 2021, when there is incomplete and evolving sea ice coverage. We apply different Machine Learning algorithms to identify types of ambient seismic noise in frequency–time scalogram images. We find evidence for two dominant noise types related to excitation of oceanic gravity waves in open water and the presence of sea ice with sufficient strength to suppress wave action. Comparison of the Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) noise clustering results with satellite‐based observations indicates that seafloor DAS can complement sea ice constraints from satellite imagery by locally increasing spatial and temporal resolution and tracking for which ice coverage is sufficient to diminish ocean waves.},

We returned the revised article to the journal on 5 June 2008, marking the last day of our observation period. The primary testable features are locations and focal mechanisms of larger (M ≥ 4.5) earthquakes; did these events happen on or very near the faults we said they would? Did they have the same strikes, dips, and rakes as the faults we modeled? In retrospect, is the stress transfer method consistent with all M ≥ 4.5 earthquakes that occurred? We find all but one M ≥ 4.5 aftershock with known focal mechanisms located on stress‐increased faults, and their focal mechanism parameters overlap with geological characteristics we used in making calculations. Six of the seven lethal M \&gt; 4.5 earthquakes that occurred in the region since 5 June 2008 were located on stress‐increased faults, with the lone exception triggered by hydraulic fracturing.},

We characterize the amplitude history and frequency content of the tremor, and we use a network covariance‐based method to estimate its source location. The tremor exhibits multiple narrow spectral peaks between 1 and 3 Hz, and its amplitude varies through time in a spasmodic manner. Our location results track a northeast migration of shallow sources through the summit region in the first few hours of the eruption. For the remainder of the eruption, source locations cluster in the vicinity of the erupting vent in the northeast rift zone. We attribute the tremor source to gas dynamics in the upper reaches of a basaltic dike. However, limitations in instrumentation and knowledge of the subsurface velocity structure may preclude an assessment of the source mechanism. Our results illustrate the value of characterizing and locating tremor for tracking magma movement, and demonstrate a use for dense and calibrated seismic instrumentation on active volcanoes. The location method we use requires substantial parameter testing, reflecting the potential benefit of developing more flexible approaches toward real‐time automated assessment of tremor at volcanoes.},

    abstract = {We compute and analyze stress drops for 4175 earthquakes (ML 0–5) in the 2008 Mogul, Nevada, swarm–mainshock sequence using a spectral decomposition approach that uses depth‐dependent path corrections. We find that the highest stress‐drop foreshocks occur within the fault zone of the Mw 4.9 mainshock, nucleating at the edges of seismicity voids and concentrating near complexities in the fault geometry, confirming and extending inferences from prior work based on empirical Green’s functions for ∼150 of the larger Mogul earthquakes. The region of the highest stress‐drop foreshocks is not reruptured by aftershocks, whereas low‐stress‐drop areas are consistently low during both the foreshock and aftershock periods, implying that stress drop depends on inherent individual fault properties rather than timing within the sequence. These results have implications for swarm evolution and fault activation within complex 3D structures.},

Accurate back‐azimuth information is important for a variety of monitoring efforts, but it is currently only available for infrasound arrays and for seismoacoustic sensor pairs separated by 10 s of meters. Our TCM method allows for the analysis of colocated sensor pairs, sensors located within a few meters of each other, which may extend the capabilities of existing seismoacoustic networks and supplement operating infrasound arrays. This approach minimizes the coherence of the transverse component of seismic displacement with the infrasound wave to estimate the infrasound back‐azimuth. After developing an analytical model, we investigate seismoacoustic signals from the August 2012 Humming Roadrunner experiment and the 26 May 2021 eruption of Great Sitkin Volcano, Alaska, U.S.A., at the ranges of 6.5–185 km from the source. We discuss back‐azimuth estimates and potential sources of deviation (1°–15°), such as local terrain effects or deviation from common analytical models. This practical method complements existing seismoacoustic tools and may be suitable for routine application to signals of interest.},

These events are targeted by the Rock Valley Direct Comparison phase of the Source Physics Experiment, as candidates for the colocation of a chemical explosion with an earthquake hypocenter to directly compare earthquake and explosion sources. For this comparison, it is necessary to determine earthquake hypocenters as accurately as possible so that different source types have nearly identical locations. Our investigations include uncertainty analysis from different sets of phase arrivals, stations, velocity models, and location algorithms. For a common set of phase arrivals and stations, we find that epicentral locations from different combinations of velocity models and algorithms are within 600 m of one another in most cases. Event depths exhibit greater uncertainties, but focusing on the S‐P times at the nearest station allows for estimates within approximately 500 m.},

The constraints are consistent with a blind rupture with 6.5 ± 0.3 m of dextral slip and 2 ± 0.5 m of reverse slip below 450 m depth.

To support these efforts, we rapidly mapped the surface rupture from satellite data with support from remote sensing and field teams, and released the results to the public in near‐real time. Detailed surface rupture mapping commenced on 7 February and continued as high‐resolution (\&lt; 1.0 m/pixel) optical images from WorldView satellites (2023 Maxar) became available. We interpreted the initial simplified rupture trace from subpixel offset fields derived from Advanced Land Observation Satellite2 and Sentinel‐1A synthetic aperture radar image pairs available on 8 and 10 February, respectively. The mapping was released publicly on 10 February, with frequent updates, and published in final form four months postearthquake (Reitman, Briggs, et al., 2023).

    abstract = {P‐arrival backazimuth estimates can be crucial in locating poorly constrained seismic events. Correlating short windows of the vertical waveform with corresponding windows of the radial rotation for different backazimuths can provide estimates, but these are often uncertain and biased due to skewness in the Z–R correlation functions. Assessing how well cosine curves centered on different backazimuths match the Z–R correlation functions provides more reliable estimates that depend less upon the time‐window used. Stacking best‐fit‐cosine curves from neighboring three‐component stations improves stability further in a form of array‐processing that does not require coherence between the waveforms themselves. We demonstrate for recordings of North Korean nuclear tests at the Pilbara 3C array in Australia that the biases in the Z–R correlation functions vary greatly between adjacent stations. This bias is reduced both by the cosine curve fitting and stacking operations. We advocate obtaining backazimuth estimates for all P arrivals at three‐component stations globally. This could improve phase association and event location, identify sensor orientation problems, and provide baseline backazimuth corrections and uncertainty estimates. We propose two benchmark datasets for developing, documenting, and comparing backazimuth estimation algorithms and codes.

The 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the Δσ distribution are 0.18, 0.51, and 1.69 MPa, respectively, and the average Δσ increases with earthquake magnitude. For the two mainshocks of the 2023 sequence, the estimated Δσ is about 13 MPa, significantly larger than the Δσ of the smaller events. At intermediate and high frequencies, the interevent residuals are correlated with Δσ. When recorded peak ground accelerations and velocities for Mw\&lt;6 are compared with the predictions from ground‐motion models proposed in the literature, the negative value of the average interevent residuals is consistent with low values of Δσ. Contrariwise, the average residuals for the peak parameter of the Mw 7.8 and 7.5 mainshocks of the 2023 sequence are almost zero, but with distance dependencies.},

Here, we focus on resolving systematic variations in the productivity of crustal earthquake sequences in California and Nevada—the two most seismically active states in the western United States. We apply a well‐tested nearest‐neighbor algorithm to automatically extract earthquake sequence statistics from a unified 40 yr compilation of regional earthquake catalogs that is complete to M ∼ 2.5. We then compare earthquake sequence productivity to geophysical parameters that may influence earthquake processes, including heat flow, temperature at seismogenic depth, complexity of quaternary faulting, geodetic strain rates, depth to crystalline basement, and faulting style. We observe coherent spatial variations in sequence productivity, with higher values in the Walker Lane of eastern California and Nevada than along the San Andreas fault system in western California. The results illuminate significant correlations between productivity and heat flow, temperature, and faulting that contribute to the understanding and ability to forecast crustal earthquake sequences in the area.},

We investigate key parameters such as overlap and probability threshold and their influences on detection consistency and false positives, respectively. EQTransformer’s probability outputs show a limited correlation with pick accuracy, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation. Our analysis of illustrative signals from three seismic networks highlights challenges of consistently picking first arrivals when reflected or refracted phases are present. We find that an overlap length of 55 s balances detection consistency and computational efficiency, and that a probability threshold of 0.1 balances detection rate and false positives. Our study thus offers insights into EQTransformer’s capabilities and limitations, highlighting the importance of parameter selection for optimal results.},

The Mw 7.8 earthquake features delayed backward branching from a steeply branching splay fault, not requiring supershear speeds. The asymmetrical dynamics of the distinct, bilateral Mw 7.7 earthquake are explained by heterogeneous fault strength, prestress orientation, fracture energy, and static stress changes from the previous earthquake. Our models explain the northward deviation of its eastern rupture and the minimal slip observed on the Sürgü fault. 3D dynamic rupture scenarios can elucidate unexpected observations shortly after major earthquakes, providing timely insights for data‐driven analysis and hazard assessment toward a comprehensive, physically consistent understanding of the mechanics of multifault systems.},

Here, we present the rapid earthquake source products produced by the USGS NEIC, describing how the source model was derived using both seismic and geodetic observations. Our analysis indicates that the earthquake was the result of oblique‐reverse faulting in the lower crust on either a steeply north‐dipping fault or a moderately south‐dipping fault. Finite‐slip models using seismic and geodetic data reveal a compact source, with slip occurring at depths of 15–35 km. The causative fault is not apparent, because the rupture did not break the surface, and it is not possible to definitively attribute the earthquake to a known structure. The earthquake centroid depth of 25 km is noteworthy, because it shows slip extending beyond common estimates of seismogenic depth. This earthquake highlights that the seismogenic processes associated with mountain building in this wide plate boundary region are poorly understood.},

To identify the faults and fault orientations most likely to host aftershocks and future large earthquakes, regional crustal stress is estimated from focal mechanism inversions, and the associated slip potential of known and suspected active faults is modeled. North–south shortening is accommodated by a mix of reverse, oblique‐reverse, and strike‐slip motion. As such, many fault orientations are well aligned for slip: steep north‐northeast‐, south‐southwest‐, southeast‐, or northwest‐striking planes, gently (∼15°–50°) dipping east‐ and west‐striking planes, and all orientations between. Nearly all mapped regional faults have high slip potential. By contrast, steep east–west and nearly all north–south faults are relatively stable, although low friction in the anomalously hot lower crust of the WHA, such as due to partial melt, could allow slip on these suboptimal faults as well.},

Catalogs of repeating earthquakes are vital for studying earthquake source processes, fault properties, and improving seismic hazard models.

We implement the “SpecUFEx” algorithm (Holtzman et al., 2018) to reduce earthquake spectrograms into low‐dimensional, characteristic fingerprints, and apply hierarchical clustering to group similar fingerprints together independent of location, allowing for a global search for potential RES throughout the data set. We then relocate the potential RES and subject them to the same detection criteria as Waldhauser and Schaff (2021). We apply our method to ∼4000 small (ML 0–3.5) earthquakes located on a 10 km long segment of the creeping SAF and double the number of detected RES, allowing for greater spatial coverage of slip‐rate estimations at seismogenic depths. Our method is novel in its ability to detect RES independent of initial locations and is complimentary to existing cross‐correlation‐based methods, leading to more complete RES catalogs and a better understanding of slip rates at depth.},

    abstract = {On 26 September 2022, two seismic events were detected by regional seismic networks, coincident with media‐reported leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the western Baltic Sea. In this study, we analyze seismic and infrasound signals from these two events and compare the seismic signals with those from other nearby seismic events such as underwater explosions and presumed earthquakes. Arrival times of seismic signals from the events on 26 September 2022 are used to show that the epicenters for both the events are in the vicinity of the Nord Stream pipelines. Signals from the two events display features that are characteristic of sources occurring near the seafloor. Observed P/S ratios from the Nord Stream events are also different from those observed for nearby presumed earthquakes. The observed seismic and infrasound signals are longer duration than would be expected from a single explosive source and show similarities with those observed from underwater volcano eruptions and gas pipeline explosions. The difference between seismic magnitudes estimated for the first Nord Stream pipeline event (MLP 2.32) and an event associated with the rupture of the Balticconnector pipeline on 7 October 2023 (MLP 1.09) is consistent with the estimated potential energy ratio of the gas in the pipelines. This suggests that the initial seismic signals from the first Nord Stream event may be dominated by energy generated by the venting of gas.},

Because La Palma Island in the Canary Archipelago is very well instrumented, we studied the possible velocity variations related to the last Cumbre Vieja eruption on 19 September 2021, aiming to obtain clear variations in the seismic velocity. For this purpose, we used the moving‐window cross‐spectral analysis technique for seismic noise within the 0.1–1.0 Hz frequency interval for determining two‐ and single‐station cross‐component correlations. During the 2018–2022 observation period, we first detected a seasonal seismic velocity variation possibly caused by annual rainfall and the induced pore pressure change. On 12 September 2021, a dramatic decrease in the velocity of −0.15\% was detected, leading to the volcanic eruption at Cumbre Vieja seven days later. The results are compatible with those of models proposed for rapid magma migration from a shallow reservoir at 11 km to the surface.},

Here, we investigate automated event detection and extraction of seismic phases using two widely used ML models: EQTransformer and PhaseNet. We applied both the models to four weeks of continuous recordings of aftershocks using a temporary array following the 30 November 2022, ML 5.6 earthquake near Peace River, Alberta, Canada. Both the tools identified \&gt;1000 events over the recording period. The aftershocks are located in close proximity to the ML 5.6 mainshock as well as to wastewater disposal operations that were ongoing at the time. Both the methods reveal an aftershock distribution that was not identified by the regional network; however, we find that events detected by PhaseNet have smaller event location errors and better depict subtle fault structures at depth, despite identifying ∼200 events less than EQTransformer. Our results highlight the advantages of using ML models for rapid detection and assessment of seismicity following felt events, which is important for rapidly assessing seismic hazard potential and risk.},

To explore faulting in this area, we excavated a paleoseismic trench across the Sawtooth fault along the western margin of the CTB, and compared an early Holocene (9.1 ± 2.1 ka, 1σ) rupture at the site with lacustrine paleoseismic data and fault mapping in the 2020 epicentral region. We find: (1) a history of partial to full rupture of the Sawtooth fault (Mw 6.8–7.4), (2) that shorter ruptures (Mw≤6.9) are likely along distributed and discontinuous faults in the epicentral region, (3) that this complex system that hosted the 2020 earthquake is not directly linked to the Sawtooth fault, (4) that the northeast‐trending TCFS likely plays a role in controlling fault length and rupture continuity for adjacent faults, and (5) that parts of the TCFS may facilitate displacement transfer between normal faults that accommodate crustal extension and rotation. Our results help unravel complex faulting in the CTB and imply that relict structures can help inform regional seismic hazard assessments.},

In the presence of good seismic network coverage, location errors are no more than a few kilometers, and detection limits are well below 1  Mm3. The combination of detection time, location, and size provides the ability to rapidly determine whether a landslide occurred close to open water and, if so, its tsunamigenic potential.

Here, we analyze waveforms recorded from dense seismic networks above the deep earthquake beneath Granada in 2010 to study the slab structure. We discover a thin low‐velocity layer (LVL) at the base of the slab to explain both the long codas observed in Morocco and the secondary arrivals observed in Spain. This LVL indicates the presence of hydrous magnesium silicates extending to ∼600 km depth, which suggests that dehydration embrittlement promotes the occurrence of deep‐focus earthquakes. Our findings contradict the traditional slab model with the LVL sitting on the top of the slab, suggesting that the Alboran slab has been overturned.},

Here, there are discrepancies between types of geological structures (transform or thrust faults) and recorded geodetic velocity vectors of plate motion. Though SAF‐type stress is recorded north of the MTJ, there has been little geological evidence for resultant strain at these latitudes on the coast. We focus on the Van Duzen fault (VDF)—a possible subsidiary fault of the Little Salmon fault system, one of the southernmost active thrust faults within the onshore fold and thrust belt associated with CSZ. The VDF deforms young river terraces of varying age, which we use to develop a relative‐age framework to contextualize activity along the VDF. Geomorphic analysis and a paleoseismic excavation across the VDF display deformation attributed to compressional stresses, which postdates young (3–11 ka) terrace deposition, at roughly 0.06–0.38 mm/yr. We hypothesize that the transition between CSZ and SAF tectonic regimes is geologically manifest through the orientation of compressional structures (i.e., VDF), which may illuminate dynamics associated with the migrating triple junction, past and present.},

Here, we show that systematically shifting the waveforms during training and using an antialiasing filter within the neural network architecture can substantially improve the consistency of the output prediction scores and can even make them scale with the signal‐to‐noise ratios of the waveforms. We demonstrate the improvements by applying these approaches to a commonly used phase‐picking neural network architecture and using waveform data from the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence.},

To delineate active faults and understand the relationship between these sequences, we applied an automated deep‐learning workflow to create enhanced and relocated earthquake catalogs for both the sequences. The enhanced catalog newly identified more than 14,000 M 0–2 earthquakes and also found 852 of 860 already cataloged events. We found that deep‐learning and template‐matching approaches complement each other to improve catalog completeness because deep learning finds more M 0–2 background seismicity, whereas template‐matching finds the smallest M \&lt; 0 events near already known events. The enhanced catalog revealed that the 2021 Petrolia and 2022 Ferndale sequences were distinct in space and time, but adjacent in space. Though both the sequences happened in the downgoing Gorda slab, the shallower Ferndale sequence ruptured within the uppermost slab near the subduction interface, while the onshore Petrolia sequence occurred deeper in the mantle. Deep‐learning‐enhanced earthquake catalogs could help monitor evolving earthquake sequences, identify detailed seismogenic fault structures, and understand space–time variations in earthquake rupture and sequence behavior in a complex tectonic setting.},

This work presents the results of an experiment conducted at the STIN site in northeastern Italy, which is equipped with a 100 m deep instrumented borehole. A seismic noise campaign was implemented by installing a temporary independent local surface array of seismological stations. The gathered data were used to initially estimate the shear‐wave velocity (VS) profile and frequency‐dependent Rayleigh‐wave attenuation, and subsequently determine the QS factor via a linearized inversion method. The study compares these findings with the VS and QS values derived from analyzing weak‐motion events recorded by two permanent seismic sensors positioned at the top and bottom of the well. The results confirm the potential of the inversion procedure used to obtain QS from local‐scale seismic noise arrays as a promising approach for conducting attenuation studies at the local level in less geologically complex sites.},

Updated GMICEs that remove these biases would improve the accuracy of alert regions for the ShakeAlert EEW system for the West Coast of the United States. ShakeAlert uses ground‐motion prediction equations (GMPEs), which calculate spatial distributions of peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV) from earthquake source estimates, combined with GMICEs to translate GMPE output into modified Mercalli intensity (MMI). We find significant epistemic uncertainty in alert distances; near‐source MMI estimates from different GMICEs can differ by over 1 MMI unit, and MMI extents used for public EEW alerts can differ by hundreds of kilometers for larger magnitude earthquakes (M ∼6.5+). We use a catalog of “Did You Feel It?” shaking reports to evaluate how well GMICEs predict observed shaking. Our preferred GMICE is the one that computes MMI using PGV for high intensities and transitions to using PGA for nondamaging intensities. These results motivate updating GMICE relationships more generally, including in ShakeMap applications.},

At the Rock Valley Direct Comparison site, the regional orientation of the maximum horizontal compressive stress (SHmax) is well constrained, but it is unknown whether there are local heterogeneities. Here, I show that stress‐induced anisotropy in nonlinear elasticity can be used to estimate the orientation of SHmax. Rocks have compliant internal contacts, such as fractures and mineral grain boundaries, that respond to applied strains more strongly than individual mineral crystals. This strain response is asymmetric between compressive and dilatational strains and is affected by anisotropy in the ambient stress field. Traditional seismic velocity measurements are of strain‐averaged velocity, which is less sensitive than nonlinear elasticity to the behavior of compliant internal contacts and therefore the stress field and fracture behavior.

    abstract = {The Texas Seismological Network (TexNet) has enabled real‐time monitoring of induced earthquakes since 2017. Before 2017, location uncertainties and temporal gaps in seismic data obscure correlations across Texas between seismicity and saltwater disposal or hydraulic fracturing. Depth biases also complicate linking anthropogenic stress changes to faults. We relocate 73 M 1.5+ earthquakes from the TXAR catalog (2009–2016) relative to the centroid of a calibrated core cluster consisting of 116 earthquakes from the TexNet catalog post‐2020, in the southern Delaware basin south of the Grisham fault zone. Hypocentroidal decomposition relocation reduces spatial uncertainties of the TXAR events to \&lt;5 km and provides updated depths. The core cluster has uncertainties less than \&lt;300 m and depth constrained from near‐source stations and S−P differential times. The majority of relocated TXAR events indicate the triggering of northwest‐trending faults at a mean depth of 1 km below sea level, suggesting a causal connection with shallow saltwater disposal and consistency with post‐2017 seismicity. Spatiotemporal patterns of pre‐2017 seismicity and saltwater disposal highlight initial triggering via pore‐pressure stress perturbations from nearby low‐volume injections and later from southeastward pressure diffusion along permeable anisotropic conduits and fracture zones. The comparison between pre‐ and post‐2017 seismicity indicates shallow fault reactivation through similar triggering mechanisms since 2009.},

    abstract = {The 17 January 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake was a watershed event with far‐reaching societal and scientific impacts. The earthquake, which occurred in the early days of both broadband seismic networks and the Internet, spurred advances in seismic monitoring, real‐time systems, and development of data products. Motivated by the 30th anniversary of the earthquake, we present a brief retrospective of the earthquake and its impact, and reconsider both ground motions and the aftershock distribution using modern tools and the best‐available data. With improvements in instrumentation and analysis methodology, recent earthquakes continue to reveal the increasing complexity of ground motions, fault systems, and earthquake ruptures. Even in the absence of data from state‐of‐the‐art instrumentation, a retrospective consideration of ground‐motion data from the Northridge earthquake reveals complexities beyond what could be characterized (and modeled) 30 yr ago. Aftershock relocations for both the 1971 Sylmar and 1994 Northridge earthquakes also reveal an updated view of fault complexity. Our study does provide a cautionary tale regarding legacy data sets and research results that are not easily accessible, which can result in discrepancies between catalog data and products from the best available science. We also briefly describe outreach products produced as a part of the anniversary commemoration.},

However, exploration, development, and monitoring of geothermal systems remain challenging. Here, we explore how recent low‐cost seismic node instrumentation advances might enhance geothermal exploration and monitoring. We show the results from 450 nodes deployed at a geothermal prospect in Cornwall, United Kingdom. First, we demonstrate how the nodes can be used to monitor the spatiotemporal and size distribution of induced seismicity. Second, we use focal mechanisms, shear‐wave source polarities, and anisotropy to indicate how the dense passive seismic observations might provide enhanced insight into the stress state of the geothermal systems. All the methods are fully automated, essential for processing the data from many receivers. In our example case study, we find that the injection‐site fracture orientations significantly differ from that of the crust above and the regional stress state. These observations agree well with fracture orientations inferred from independent well‐log data, exemplifying how the nodes can provide new insight for understanding the geothermal systems. Finally, we discuss the limitations of nodes and the role they might play in hybrid seismic monitoring going forward. Overall, our results emphasize the important role that low‐cost, easy‐to‐deploy dense nodal arrays can play in geothermal exploration and operation.},

We find two distinct seismic signals and develop a conceptual and physical model explaining the observations: initially, the high‐energy seismic signals (0.02–0.06 Hz) occurred, followed by an over one‐week‐long monochromatic signal (0.0109 Hz) recorded even at 5000 km distance. Our single force (SF) inversions characterize both an initial rockslide and the one‐week‐long seiche oscillation processes. The rockslide signal is well reproduced by west and downward SF, with an orientation consistent with observations on satellite imagery. The amplitude decay of the week‐long oscillation, stacked at three teleseismic arrays, is fitted with a damped oscillator model. Using a simple analytical model of water seiching in a narrow fjord, we can explain the force direction and frequency consistent with the results from SF inversion.},

We analyze ∼24 km of land‐based P‐wave seismic‐reflection data that fill in a critical gap in our understanding of the SFZ beneath the urban areas of West Seattle, south‐central Seattle, and Mercer Island. These data image deformed strata in the upper 1 km, including upwarped Tertiary rock and younger sediments. Collectively, these data provide evidence for multiple Quaternary‐active thrust faults, back thrusts, and sub‐basins within the SFZ beneath the city of Seattle. The results indicate that multiple and potentially active back thrusts in the upper ∼500 m extend across the length of the SFZ and the entire urban corridor that may be analogous to those on Bainbridge Island west of Puget Sound.},

The U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) relies on mb in its global real‐time earthquake monitoring mission. Although waveform modeling‐based moment magnitudes are the modern standard to characterize earthquake size, mb is important because (1) in many cases, waveform modeling is not possible (e.g., low signal‐to‐noise events), (2) mb is applicable over a broad range of magnitudes, ∼M 4–7, and (3) there is a many decades‐long history of estimating mb magnitudes. We use the NEIC Preliminary Determination of Epicenters earthquake catalog to investigate the uncertainty in NEIC station mb measurements. We show that mb measurements are spatially correlated, which can bias event mb, and we describe an empirical relation between this spatial correlation and station‐to‐station distance. We further describe an approach to mitigate bias from the spatial correlation. Accounting for the spatial covariance of observations can change the event mb from −0.15 to 0.07 mb units (10th to 90th percentile) for smaller events (mb≤4.5). These smaller events have the largest mb standard deviations ranging from 0.05 to 0.15 mb units (10th to 90th percentile).},

In the past decade, several ULVZs, and particularly the Hawaiian ULVZ, have been studied using postcursors to core‐diffracted S waves (Sdiff), which constrain their shear‐wave velocity reduction. Simultaneous observations of P‐wave velocity would allow us to better constrain the origin of ULVZs. We present the first observations of core‐diffracted P‐wave (Pdiff) postcursors likely generated by the Hawaiian ULVZ, at much shorter periods (∼1 s) than those typically associated with Sdiff postcursors (10–20 s). We analyze Sdiff postcursors from previous studies in two different period ranges for comparison. The observed delay times can be explained by a P‐wave velocity reduction of 20\%–30\%. If we assume that the Pdiff postcursor is caused by the presence of a very thin basal layer (with estimated VS reduction of ∼40\%), δVP:δVS ranges from 1:1.3 to 1:2. Iron enrichment is able to explain this ratio, whereas partial melt cannot. We also observe an anomalously high slowness for the Pdiff postcursors, which could suggest that the postcursors are not caused by the ULVZ but rather by scattering anomalies at 2400 km depth. We prefer the ULVZ hypothesis.},

We determine the focal mechanism, which is oblique faulting, and retrieve the Lg‐wave relative source time functions (RSTFs) from the stations at regional distances to understand rupture processes and ground motions. Our fault‐slip models well explain azimuthal variations of the RSTFs. The models show the rupture propagating toward the east‐northeast (∼50° to 60°), not along the fault strike. The slip distribution on the nodal plane striking north and dipping to the east shows a slip area of 1.1 km radius with the rupture propagating down‐dip. The down‐dip rupture may account for the observed lack of strong shaking in the epicentral area.},

We use synthetic waveforms to validate the observed scaling relations and to provide additional insight into the differences between instrumental and physics‐based magnitude scales. Each earthquake in our catalog is assigned a clustering designation distinguishing mainshocks from triggered seismicity, along with a potency‐based magnitude estimate that is comparable to moment magnitude and that can be easily converted into other magnitude scales as needed. The developed catalog and associated scaling relations have broad applications for fundamental and applied studies of earthquake processes and hazards.},

However, the amplitude of the lithosphere–asthenosphere velocity gradient diminishes beneath the arc, consistent with a reduction in the shear‐wave velocity of the deep upper‐plate lithosphere. This zone lies above mantle wedge velocity anomalies which indicate upward‐migrating partial melt, suggesting that ascending melt has altered and weakened the lithospheric mantle of the upper plate. In northwestern Nicaragua, the boundary of the Central American fore‐arc sliver and the Caribbean plate, which is marked by a northeast decrease in geodetically measured arc‐parallel surface velocities, lies above the northeast increase in the amplitude and localization of the lithosphere–asthenosphere velocity gradient. This correlation indicates that the kinematic margin of the Central American fore‐arc sliver corresponds to a structural boundary that extends throughout the upper plate, and that is influenced by melt ascending from the mantle wedge.},

We illustrate such a method by not only eliciting priors for ETAS parameters for the Pacific Northwest (PNW), a subduction zone with a complex tectonic environment, but also a relatively small catalog.

    abstract = {It has been recognized that the between‐event variability of peak ground acceleration (PGA) is significantly smaller than the variability of the stress drop calculated from corner frequency (the spectral stress drop). Resolving this discrepancy is indispensable for improving seismic hazard assessment because the spectral stress drop is considered a fundamental parameter for predicting high‐frequency ground motions. This study addresses this paradox for Mw 3.6–7.1 crustal earthquakes in Japan. Two factors are essential for resolving the problem: (1) calculating the spectral stress drop using a high‐frequency‐fitted corner frequency (called the stress parameter Δσfch) and (2) considering the magnitude dependence of Δσfch. To estimate Δσfch, the source spectra for crustal earthquakes in Japan are obtained using the two‐stage spectral ratio method, which enables the estimation of double‐corner‐frequency spectra. This two‐stage approach is more effective for accurately estimating Δσfch than the standard spectral ratio approach that assumes the single‐corner frequency model. This study shows that Δσfch increases with increasing magnitude up to Mw∼5.5 and then becomes constant. The variability of Δσfch calculated by considering this magnitude dependence of Δσfch aligns with the between‐event variability of PGA. Incorporating a double‐corner‐frequency model is crucial for predicting ground‐motion variability and enhancing seismic hazard assessments.},

    abstract = {The proximity of wastewater disposal to the Precambrian basement is a critical factor influencing induced earthquake rates in the Central United States, but the impact of reducing injection depths has not been widely demonstrated. Beginning in 2015, state regulatory efforts in Oklahoma and Kansas mandated that wells injecting into the lower Arbuckle Group, a basal sedimentary unit, be backfilled with cement (i.e., “plugged back”) so that they inject into shallower formations. This plug back activity gives us a unique opportunity to investigate the relationship between injection depth and induced seismicity rate. To evaluate the impact that decreased injection rates and plug backs had on the seismicity rates, we created a suite of rate–state earthquake models. Observed seismicity rates are best fit when only lower Arbuckle volumes are considered, suggesting the lower Arbuckle injectors were primarily responsible for the seismicity and that plug backs were effective at isolating the injected volumes to shallower formations. Our models demonstrate that if these wells had not been plugged back, seismicity rates would be multiple times larger than they are today. We find that the combination of well plug backs and injection volume decreases can be an effective strategy for reducing induced seismicity rates.},

We focused on two far‐regional stations (∼1000 km) in two period bands 20–50 and 15–40 s, for which path propagation effects over many wavelengths accumulate and pose challenges to low‐magnitude nuclear explosion monitoring (NEM). Four seismic models were considered: two average radially symmetric 1D and two fully 3D models. Model performance was evaluated with metrics of waveform phase (cross‐correlation delay time), shape (correlation coefficient), and amplitude (variance reduction with delay time shift) and averaged into a summary score. We found that a recent 3D model based on full waveform inversion (FWI) tomography including radial anisotropy and crustal thickness variations performs on average better than the alternatives. Results suggest that FWI based on crustal depth earthquakes can provide useful 3D models for NEM. Such models can be used for the simulation of Green’s functions for source characterization including moment tensor inversion and source type characterization (e.g., explosion–earthquake–collapse identification, moment and yield estimation).},

Preattack activity involved large‐scale mobilization, as was documented by various media sources. Opportune conditions stemming from a temporary reduction in Israeli anthropogenic activity enabled the identification of signals generated by vehicular movement in Gaza at three regional seismic stations. Seismogram analysis reveals a widespread signal that abruptly emerged above the nighttime noise levels about 20 min before the attack began. Previous Saturday mornings did not exhibit interstation correlations and signal amplitudes as high as the ones observed on the three stations in the minutes before the attack began. Statistical analysis suggests the October 7 preattack signal is highly anomalous and unlikely to emerge by chance. Tripartite array analysis was used to detect surface waves, locate their sources, and demarcate the extent of preattack activity within the Gaza Strip. The signal’s amplitude, frequency, and spatiotemporal distribution appear to be aligned with vehicular traffic emanating from the south‐central region of the Gaza Strip and extending toward its peripheries in the half‐hour window preceding the invasion. This analysis underscores the potential utility of seismic noise measurements in identifying large‐scale terrorist vehicular mobilizations in advance.},

However, passive imaging with DAS in urban settings presents challenges such as strong diurnal traffic noise, nonlinear array geometry, and poor fiber coupling to the ground. We repurposed a dark fiber in Melbourne, Australia, into a 25 km DAS array that traces busy arterial roads, tram routes, and orthogonal sections. By employing noise cross correlation and array beamforming, we calculated dispersion curves and successfully inverted for a near‐surface shear‐wave velocity model down to 100 meters. Stationary seismic sources are maximized by selecting daytime traffic signals, thereby recovering surface waves and reducing interference from acoustic waves from man‐made structures in the subsurface. Poorly coupled channels, which are linked to fiber maintenance pits, are identified through cross‐correlation amplitudes. The dispersion curve calculation further considers the channel orientation to avoid mixing Rayleigh and Love waves. Using a trans‐dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling approach, we achieved effective model inversion without a prior reference model. The resulting near‐surface profile aligns with mapped lithology and reveals previously undocumented lithological variation.},

Records from infrasound sensors deployed on either side of a wall facing the volcano were used to measure differential dynamic pressures of more than 50 Pa imparted to the wall facing the volcano. We calculated the building’s infrasonic response as a function of frequency for situations where interior doors were both open and closed and found a remarkably well‐defined ∼7.5 Hz tone induced by acoustic oscillations when the interior door was open. The transfer functions, from a week‐long period of recording and 34 explosions, show that closing internal doors diminishes infrasonic resonance and could potentially reduce window damage.},

    abstract = {The traditional method of representing the seismicity in a region involves plotting earthquakes of various magnitudes on a map. Energy release, however, offers a different perspective for understanding seismicity, especially in volcanic areas where earthquakes are abundant and occur in the form of swarms. In this study, we analyzed earthquakes with a moment magnitude (Mw) greater than 1.5 that occurred between 2006 and 2023, which were relocated using a 3D velocity model, to examine the distribution of energy space density (ESD) in the Etna region. The ESD maps reveal the fundamental patterns of seismicity, which generally align with the local structural features. The shallow crust above 10 km plays a crucial role in energy distribution, with the highest values found in the eastern and southwestern sectors, along well‐known structures bordering the unstable sector of the volcano. At deeper levels (down to 20 km), high ESD values are observed in the western sector and are related to the dynamics of magma movement at these depths. The ESD pattern improves the clarity of rock fracture density visualization, offering a more detailed view of the areas with the highest fracture density. These regions may indicate where fluid is stored beneath the volcano.},

The exceptionally deep Mw 7.9 Bonin Islands earthquake, which occurred at a depth of 680 km in a region previously thought to be aseismic, provides a rare opportunity to investigate the behavior and mechanism of deep earthquakes. Using an array‐based beamforming technique, we flag numerous false detections in previous work, detect additional aftershocks following the Bonin Islands earthquake, and relocate using backprojection. The aftershocks are located outside the mainshock rupture zone and are aligned along a plane that extends from the mainshock rupture, suggesting a deformation migration across a pre‐existing zone of weakness. These observations are compatible with the hypothesis of a thin metastable olivine wedge within the lower part of the Izu–Bonin slab, which may play a role in the deep earthquake mechanism. We reject a previous claim of deeper aftershock activity within the lower mantle. Our results further the understanding of the structure of the mantle and the physical mechanisms driving deep‐focus earthquakes.},

Here, we test the Dice loss, which is a preferred loss function for highly imbalanced image segmentation problems. We show that phase‐picking neural networks trained on the Dice loss behave in a binary fashion for which the prediction output is almost always either nearly 1 or nearly 0. This feature removes the strong dependence of data processing workflows on the prediction score threshold, which is an otherwise critical parameter to determine when using neural networks trained on the cross‐entropy loss. When strategically used, models trained on the Dice loss can reduce the parameter dependency of machine learning‐based seismic monitoring.},

Predicted recurrence rates for earthquakes on the East Hispaniola and Puerto Rico trench faults are 220–450 yr for moment magnitude (M) 7 and 3000–5000 yr for M 8, with the maximum feasible magnitude of M 8.2.

Calais et al. (2023) suggested that shortening in western Hispaniola is accommodated on the offshore Jérémie and onshore Malpasse faults north and south of EF, instead of on terrestrial faults in the western Hispaniola and EF. Because of our system‐modeling approach, such a configuration predicts less frequent earthquakes on EF and western Hispaniola and Muertos convergent zones. Recurrence times of a few hundred years for M 6.7 earthquakes are predicted on the submerged faults in Mona Passage, and infrequent M \&gt; 7 earthquakes are predicted on the Virgin Islands faults.},

The Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction algorithm was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and generate 2D embeddings. Then, the Hierarchical Density‐Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise method was employed to automatically group these embeddings into distinct signal clusters. Our analysis of over 1400 hr (around 59 days) of continuous seismic data revealed five and seven signal clusters at two separate stations. At both stations, we identified clusters associated with background noise and vehicle traffic, with the latter’s temporal patterns aligning closely with the facility’s work schedule. Furthermore, the algorithms detected signal clusters from unknown sources and underline the ability of unsupervised machine learning for uncovering previously unrecognized patterns. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of unsupervised approaches in examining continuous seismic data without requiring prior knowledge or pre‐existing labels.},

In geothermal fields, shut‐ins are periodically conducted for the maintenance of wells and surface infrastructure, thereby offering recurring means of estimating stress changes in the subsurface that lead to increased seismicity rates. Here, we examine daily production and microseismicity data from the Coso geothermal field (CGF) in California between 1996 and 2010 to investigate the repetitive trends of operational shut‐in microseismicity. Using 24 local seismic stations, we first analyze spatial and temporal trends of over 60,000 earthquakes with magnitudes between −0.4 and 3.8. We find that the northern region exhibits no significant seismicity changes during shut‐ins, whereas the rest of the field experiences induced seismicity during almost every shut‐in with an increasing intensity toward the southern and eastern portions of the field, possibly highlighting local differences in stress within the CGF. In addition, we cluster the seismicity using waveform cross‐correlation, revealing several earthquake clusters primarily occurring during shut‐in periods. These observations suggest that certain fracture and fault sections respond rapidly to changes in pore pressure and poroelastic stresses within the geothermal system, possibly highlighting main fluid pathways.},

Felt reports from residents were the only available information about the swarm when it started, as American Samoa lacked a seismic monitoring network. We developed a consistent single‐station catalog for the entire swarm, using seismic data from the nearest station IU.AFI, ∼250 km away. We applied the EQTransformer deep‐learning model (Mousavi et al., 2020), automatically picking Pn and Sn arrivals on IU.AFI continuous data. We retained only events with Sn–Pn times of 22.5–25 s, consistent with the expected locations based on felt reports, then detected smaller swarm events with subsequent template‐matching. This single‐station catalog characterized the swarm’s onset and escalation to peak activity before a multiagency field response team installed a local seismic network in mid‐August 2022. This permanent seismic network captured the swarm’s decline. EQTransformer identified short S–P times on the first two locally deployed seismometers, both Raspberry Shake sensors, to constrain the swarm’s distance from Ta‘ū Island. Modern seismological processing methods, combined with basic observations such as felt reports, can quickly contribute useful information during an earthquake response in a poorly monitored region.},

Typical discriminant approaches are rooted in fundamental, physics‐based differences in radiation pattern or wave excitation, which can be frequency‐dependent and may not make use of the full waveform. In this article, we explore whether phase and amplitude distances derived from dynamic time warping (DTW) and elastic shape analysis (ESA) can inform event discrimination. We demonstrate the ability to distinguish underground point sources using synthetic waveforms calculated for a 1D Earth model and various source mechanisms. We then apply the method to recorded data from events in the Korean Peninsula, which includes declared nuclear explosions, a collapse event, and naturally occurring earthquakes. Phase and amplitude distances derived from DTW and ESA are then used to classify the event types via dendrogram and k‐nearest‐neighbor clustering analyses. Using information from the full waveform, we show how different underground sources can be distinguished at regional distances. We highlight the potential of these nonlinear alignment algorithms for discrimination and comment on ways we can extend the framework presented here.},

    abstract = {Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) records represent the strain (rate) in an optical fiber averaged over a gauge length about a specified channel. In the presence of bends and variable coupling to the surroundings, the effect of gauge‐length averaging is more complex than for a straight cable. Analysis for an incident plane wavefront shows how both changes in cable orientation and coupling can produce significant changes in signal amplitude in the immediate neighborhood of the change. Coupling effects can be distinguished by the strong correlation of P and S behavior because orientation factors differ for the two wavetypes. Such effects are illustrated with DAS records from an urban cable in Perth, Western Australia, with cable segments along nearly orthogonal streets in a grid pattern and also long cable loops with poor ground coupling.},

We conducted a differential analysis based on pre‐ and postearthquake digital elevation models and field surveys at two sites where particularly prominent deformations occurred in the northeastern peninsula. Our results determined the compression of the river plain and the extensional scarps on the back slopes, causing deep‐seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD). These extensional scarps occurred along pre‐existing DSGSD features, such as linear depressions and uphill‐facing scarps, implying repeated growth. The Noto Peninsula has been repeatedly struck by large earthquakes, as evidenced by historical records and Pleistocene and Holocene marine terraces along the northern peninsular coast. The Noto Peninsula may be hiding multiple DSGSD features, but the DSGSD features we discovered have high potential as targets for off‐fault paleoseismology research to help reconstruct the history of large earthquake events on the peninsula.},

Contemporaneous to the earthquake sequence, bEPIC, an update to the ShakeAlert early warning algorithm Earthquake Point‐source Integrated Code (EPIC), was undergoing development tests in real‐time. The observed earthquake sequence provided a rich dataset of earthquakes in which we could test the performance of bEPIC. bEPIC improved epicenter estimates with an average 29.7 km reduction in location error compared to EPIC solutions for matched events. The improvement in location also improved per event magnitude estimates. Although EPIC on average overestimated the maximum magnitude of the earthquakes in the sequence by 0.37 magnitude units, bEPIC more closely aligned with our ground‐truth catalog with a much lower overestimate of only 0.05 magnitude units. Despite including more information in the grid‐search algorithm, bEPIC did not increase the average time to the first alert. The improvements in the accuracy of the earthquake parameters ultimately improve the accuracy of potential alerting polygons, which are related to the solved location and magnitude. These promising results indicate that improved accuracy with no cost to timeliness can be achieved for offshore earthquakes in northern California through the incorporation of bEPIC in early warning operating procedures.},

This is enabled by the first in‐depth, quantitative analyses of such data. We first examine a scenario where the lab‐based earthquake source is located inside a basin and find that the reverberation of body waves can coincide with high‐amplitude surface waves, leading to further amplification of ground motions. We also examine a case where the earthquake source is outside a basin and seismic waves are traveling toward the basin. We identify significant seismic energy reflecting from the intricate basin interface structures, particularly at steep parts of the interface where the basin depth changes abruptly. These reflections contribute to amplified ground motions near these steep basin interfaces. Furthermore, we find that relatively low‐frequency waves can reflect off basin interface structures with length scales as small as approximately one‐eighth of their wavelengths. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating detailed basin structures for accurate ground‐motion assessments, demonstrating that this 3D‐printing‐based approach provides an effective means for achieving that.},

Notably, in the center of the shale, there is a small area where both causal factors overlap. Furthermore, a cluster of earthquakes on the Mexican side of the national border is almost certainly triggered by SWD within Texas. To our knowledge, this is the first such documented case globally. Next, our analysis investigated the causal factors of the 2011 Mw 4.8 Fashing earthquake and of two recent Mw 3.9 events, while also confirming that HF was the key driving force behind the 2018 Mw 4.0 rupture. We employed new earthquake catalogs, established physics‐based principles, and a robust hypothesis testing framework.},

In the past decade, seismicity in the Weiyuan region of the southern Sichuan basin has increased dramatically following massive hydraulic fracturing activities. Here, we apply a multitask deep learning model, PhaseNet+, to local dense seismic records to enhance the focal mechanism catalog. 38,518 earthquakes are first detected and well located using predicted phase arrivals and the improved 1D velocity models. From predicted P polarities and measured S/P ratios, 20,740 focal mechanisms of varying qualities are then computed. Among 4399 high‐quality focal mechanisms, about 92\% are primarily associated with reverse faulting. It agrees well with moment tensor focal mechanisms from previous studies and the local tectonic settings, suggesting that the enhanced catalog can provide reliable faulting mechanisms. We observe clear spatial perturbations in their P‐axis azimuths, mainly associated with variations in fault strikes. Nevertheless, changes in the stress field at short‐length scales are also obvious, likely caused by intersected fault structures. Recent fluid injection operations and moderate earthquakes in Weiyuan may have further altered the subsurface stress state, demanding more detailed investigations.},

These pulses were analyzed using a single‐force model with Bayesian bootstrap‐based probabilistic inversion, providing insight into the complex forces driving the landslide. This landslide consisted of two mass movements: (F1) westward detachment on a steep slope and (F2) north‐northeast movement on a gentler slope, with significant impacts consistent with field observations and optical imagery. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar detected continuous slow deformation over four years at mean rates of up to 60 mm/yr. The cyanide leach pond exhibits critical 85 mm/yr deformation with the risk of environmental contamination because it contains poisonous waste and is located close to the Euphrates River.

Application of the machine‐learning (ML)‐based EarthQuake Compact Convolutional Transformer (EQCCT) algorithm to seismic data from 2008 to 2011 resulted in the detection of 645 seismic events in the area, lowering the magnitude detection threshold compared to public catalogs (e.g., U.S. Geological Survey ComCat with 35 events in the same period). Manual review and relocation using NonLinLoc and hierarchical clustering with GrowClust3D revealed seven seismic clusters: four clusters align with mapped Quaternary faults, whereas three clusters correspond to previously unrecognized seismogenic structures. These results demonstrate that advanced ML techniques can enhance earthquake detection and refine the understanding of regional seismicity.

    abstract = {Modeling seismic activity rates and clustering plays an important role in studies of induced seismicity associated with mining and other resource extraction operations. This is critical for understanding the physical and statistical characteristics of seismicity and assessing the associated hazard. In this work, we introduce the generalization of the nearest‐neighbor distance (NND) method by incorporating an arbitrary distribution function for the frequency–magnitude statistics of seismic events. Operating within a rescaled hyperspace that includes spatial, temporal, and magnitude domains, the NND method provides an effective framework for examining seismic clustering. By integrating a mixture of the two tapered Pareto distributions, the generalized NND approach accommodates deviations from standard frequency–magnitude scaling when studying the clustering properties of seismicity. In addition, the application of the temporal Hawkes process to model the mining seismicity rate reveals that the seismicity is primarily driven by external factors and lacks pronounced interevent triggering. A case study from a potash mine in Saskatchewan is presented to illustrate the application of the generalized NND method and the Hawkes process to estimate the clustering properties and occurrence rates of induced microseismicity. The implications of observed temporal variations and clustering behavior are discussed, providing insights into the nature of induced seismicity within mining environments.},

Mars, however, because of its relatively large core, is only expected to exhibit the equivalent of Earth’s uppermost transition zone seismic discontinuity. We searched the InSight seismic data for marsquakes and impacts located in an epicentral distance range favorable for detection of seismic phases that have interacted with Mars’s olivine transition (midmantle) discontinuity. Through application of careful data selection criteria and processing schemes, we found 13 events in the distance range in which body waves are expected to refract through the midmantle of Mars. Although triplicated body waves are potentially present in seven events, the distance distribution is insufficient to allow for unambiguous detection of the triplicated waveform pattern associated with the midmantle discontinuity. Comparison of travel times of the observed waveforms with predictions from recent Mars models indicates the possible presence of a midmantle discontinuity located between 987 and 1052 km or 1075 and 1122 km depth, in which the uncertainty comes from our inability to reliably distinguish first from secondary arrivals.},

Here, we evaluate the potential for deep learning model output phase detection probabilities to contribute to event‐type classification, particularly discrimination of single‐fired borehole explosions and earthquakes at local distances (\&lt;300 km). Motivated by the empirical success of P/S amplitude ratios, we consider the difference between P and S pick probability output from previously developed phase detection models, Pprob−Sprob, as a discriminant. Test data include ML∼1–4 earthquakes and explosions observed by common seismographs in ten geologically diverse localities. Depending on the picking model and training data, binary classification using Pprob−Sprob with at least three stations can achieve approximately equivalent classification accuracy as P/S amplitude ratios without requiring any customization. Joint classification with P/S and Pprob−Sprob improves accuracy for most quality control scenarios. Pick probabilities are an efficient attribute to consider in explosion discrimination because they can be automated byproducts of event detection. They avoid the binary choice of picking or not picking weakly visible S waves common to explosions.},

A four‐station network, installed in March, showed a shallow (1–3 km) southeast–northwest‐oriented reverse fault, consistent with global and regional Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) solutions. The rupture size (5 km long × 3 km wide) and 1 m slip (from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data) indicate a stress drop of 5–12 MPa, larger than the average in mid‐plate South America. The large non‐double‐couple (DC) component of all CMT solutions is probably due to a complex rupture geometry, suggested by the aftershock distribution. None of the usual hypotheses to explain intraplate seismicity (weakness zones, stress concentration, and flexural stresses) is applicable to this event. There are no signs of crustal weakness zones: the major Paleoproterozoic faults trend southwest–northeast, orthogonal to the southeast–northwest rupture; the Mesozoic Takutu graben is 65 km away. None of the surface‐wave tomographies indicate lithospheric thinning. Free‐air anomalies near the epicenter have average values and do not indicate crustal loads increasing stresses locally. In the isolated epicentral area there is no mining activity nor hydroelectric reservoir to induce seismicity. No prior seismogenic feature was found to explain this activity.},

We investigate DYFI reports for six California earthquakes that had EEW alerts and substantial responses to the DYFI EEW questionnaire. Comparisons of ShakeAlert predictions to reported intensities demonstrate that magnitude estimation accuracy is not necessarily indicative of ground‐motion prediction accuracy. Perceived warning time distributions from DYFI indicate that estimating maximum‐expected warning times using the S‐wave arrival is reasonable for discussing public EEW performance. However, we also find many reports of shorter warning times, late alerts, and missed alerts than expected based on ShakeAlert publication times, indicating alert delivery latencies are substantial and highly variable. The novelty of our analysis is that we demonstrate that the DYFI EEW survey provides useful EEW efficacy information, independent of the specific alerting pathway, that can be used to inform our choices for conveying EEW performance.},

These findings align closely with existing geological databases, including microgravity measurements, known faults, and depth‐to‐bedrock variations, validating the accuracy of the DAS‐derived shear‐wave velocity model. This research enhances seismic hazard analysis and mitigation strategies in the Reno area by refining existing shear‐wave velocity models.},

    abstract = {On 28 March 2025, an Mw 7.8 shallow strike‐slip earthquake ruptured ∼480 km of the 1200 km long Sagaing fault extending north–south across central Myanmar. This active right‐lateral fault hosted six major earthquakes in the twentieth century and locates along the two largest cities of Myanmar, constituting a major seismic hazard. The rupture, constrained by finite‐fault inversion of teleseismic body waves, backprojections of short‐period P waves, and informed by initial Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery of surface deformation has large slip of up to 7 m extending ∼85 km north of the epicenter near Mandalay, with patchy slip of 1–6 m distributed along ∼395 km to the south, with about 2 m near the capital Nay Pyi Taw. Rupture expanded at a supershear velocity of 5–6 km/s southward, during the ∼80 s rupture duration. Long‐period point‐source moment tensors indicate eastward dip of 48.5°–60°, and such dip is required to match the teleseismic P‐wave first motions for the early large slip in the northern part of the rupture. Dip likely steepens along strike to the south, although resolving that will require detailed analysis of surface deformation. Southward directivity associated with the finiteness and supershear rupture velocity contributed to remote distant shaking damage in Thailand.},

    abstract = {On‐fault geological observations from surface‐breaking earthquakes typically contain curved slickenlines, suggesting fault slip is curved. However, slickenlines commonly record only a fraction of coseismic slip, making it difficult to reconstruct the full slip trajectory. Near‐fault seismic records, though capable of capturing ground motions associated with rupture, are limited in their ability to constrain on‐fault slip direction because they record motion on only one side of the fault. Here, we overcome these challenges by directly observing fault slip using video footage of the 2025 Mw 7.7 Myanmar, strike‐slip earthquake. We use pixel cross correlation to track features in successive frames of the video, revealing a pulse of fault slip with a magnitude of 2.5 ± 0.5 m, a duration of 1.3 ± 0.2 s, and a peak velocity of 3.2 ± 1.0 m/s. The observed trajectory is notably curved and includes a transient (0.3 m) dip‐slip component on a steeply dipping strike‐slip fault. These observations are consistent with geological records of curved slickenlines, supporting mechanical models that link rupture propagation direction to near‐surface slip curvature. Our results provide the first direct visual evidence of curved coseismic fault slip, bridging a critical gap among seismological observations, geological data, and theoretical models.},

    abstract = {We report a full waveform inversion tomography model of Alaska and the surrounding regions, inferring radially anisotropic shear and isotropic compressional wavespeeds by fitting complete waveforms from 120 regional earthquakes. Our multiscale approach inverted time–frequency phase misfits (maximum period of 100 s), starting with a minimum period of 40 s and ending at 20 s in 7 stages and 112 total iterations. The model (AK112) was evaluated by computing the misfits for 36 independent validation events. We find that misfit reductions were large and equal (∼55\%) for both the inversion and validation data sets, providing confidence in the model. AK112 also provides much better waveform fits compared to other reported models for the region, including an isotropic version of itself, highlighting the importance of anisotropy. The model resolves known crustal, upper mantle, and slab structure to depths of 100 km with new detail: sedimentary basins in the Alaskan Shelf, Cook Inlet, and Colville basins, among others; discontinuous lithospheric structure across major terrane boundaries; and subducting slab geometry and back‐arc volcanic sources. In addition to tectonic interpretations, the model enables full waveform simulations for long‐period earthquake ground motions and source characterization (e.g., moment tensor and finite‐fault inversion).},
